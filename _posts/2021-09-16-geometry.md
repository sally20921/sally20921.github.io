exerpt: "Geometry is a branch of mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. Points, vectors, and matrices are instrumental in the process of making computer vision/graphics images; In this blog post, you will learn what these constructs are, how they work and the various techniques that can be used to manipulate them."

<h2> Coordinate Systems </h2>

<h3> Introducing Coordinate Systems </h3>

Coordinate systems play an essential role in the graphics pipeline. They are not complicated; However, learning a few things about them will make it easier to understand matrices.

I mentioned that points and vectors (as used in computer vision/graphics) are represented with 3 real numbers. But what do these numbers mean? Each number represents <span class="blue"> a signed distance </span> from the origin of a line to the position of the point on that line. 

Consider drawing a line and putting a mark in the middle. We will call this mark origin. This mark becomes our point of reference: the position from which we will measure the distance to any other points. If a point lies to the right side of the origin, we take the signed distance to be greater than zero. On the other hand, if it is on the left side of the origin, the values will be negative.

Now that we have a line and an origin, we add some additional marks at a regular interval (unit length) on each side of the origin, effectively turning our line into a ruler. With the ruler established, we can simply use it to measure the coordinate of a point from the origin (coordinate is another way of saying the signed distance from the origin to the point). In mathematics, the ruler defines what we call <span class="red"> axis </span>. We have just learned to define the coordinate of a point along an axis. 

<h3> Dimensions and Cartesian Coordinate Systems </h3>

By placing two axes called $x$-axis and $y$-axis, we have defined a two dimensional space called a <span class="neon"> plane </span>. These two axes are said to define a coordinate system. <span class="underline"> If these two rulers are perpendicular to each other, they define what we call a Cartesian coordinate system. </span>

We now know how to make a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system and define the coordinates of a 2D point in that coordinate system. Note that <mark class="gold"> the coordinates of points defined in a coordinate system are unique </span>. The same point cannot be represented by two different sets of coordinates in one system. We are free to choose any coordinate system that we please.

In fact, we can choose to define infinitely many coordinate systems in a plane. Let's assume we drew two Cartesian coordinate system like the figure above. On this paper, we place one point. <span class="stroke"> The coordinates of that point will be different </span> depending on which of the two coordinate system we consider. 

<span class="highlight-gradient"> If you know the coordinates of $P$ in coordinate system $A$, </span> what do you need to do <span class="underline-pink"> to find the coordinate of the same point in another coordinate system $B$? </span> This represents an extremely important operation in computer vision, and we will soon learn why and how to find the map which translates the coordinates of a point from one coordinate system to another.

Another common operation is to move the point in the coordinate system $A$ to another location in the same coordinate system. This is called a <span class="gradient"> translation </span> and is certainly one of the basic operations you can do on points. 

Note that all sorts of other linear operators can be applied to point coordinates. A multiplication of a real number to the coordinate of point produces <span class="blue"> scale </span>. A scale moves $P$ along the line that is going through the point and the origin. That is because when we are transforming a point we are actually transforming the vector going from origin to the point. 

<h3> The Third Dimension </h3>

The 3D coordinate system is a simple extension of the 2D case. We will be adding a third axis orthogonal to both the $x$- and $y$-axis called the $z$-axis (representative of depth). In geometry, 3D coordinate system defines what is more formally known as <span class="blink"> Euclidean Space </span>. In linear algebra, the three axes from what we call the <span class="flow"> basis </span> of that coordinate system. 

A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that, in a linear combination, can represent every vector (or point) in a given vector space (the coordinate system). 

<div class="sidenote"> Vectors from a set are said to be linearly independent if and only if none of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of other vectors in that set. </div>

Change of basis, or change of coordinate system, is a common operation in mathematics and computer vision pipeline.

<h3> Left-Handed vs Right-Handed Coordinate Systems </h3>

Unfortunately, due to various conventions concerning handedness, coordinate systems are not that simple. The problem can be illustrated in the following figure: when the up and forward vectors are oriented in the same way, an appropriate right vector can either point to the left or to the right.

To differentiate the two conventions, we call the first coordinate system the left-handed coordinate system, and the other, the right-handed coordinate system. 

<mark class="coral"> Remember that the middle finger always represent the right vector when checking the coordinate handedness. </mark> 

<div class="blockquote"> The handedness of the coordinate system also plays a role in the orientation of normals computed from the edges of polygonal faces. If the orientation is right-handed, then polygons whose vertices were specified in counterclockwise order will be front-facing. This will be explained in the part on rendering polygon objects. </div>
