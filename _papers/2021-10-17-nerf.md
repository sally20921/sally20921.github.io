excerpt: "We present a method that achieves state-of-the-art results for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views. Our algorithm represents a scene using a fully-connected (non-convolutional) deep network, whose input is a single continuous 5D coordinate (spatial location $(x,y,z)$ and viewing direction $(\theta, \phi)$) and whose output is the volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance at that spatial location. We synthesize views by querying 5D coordinates along camera rays and use classic volume rendering techniques to project the output colors and densities into an image. Because volume rendering is naturally differentiable, the only input required to optimize our representation is a set of images with known camera poses."

<h2> Optimizing a Neural Radiance Field </h2>

<h3> Hierarchical Volume Sampling </h3>

Our rendering strategy of densely evaluating the neural radiance field network at $N$ query points along each camera ray is inefficient: free space and occluded regions that do not contribute to the rendered image are still sampled repeatedly. We draw inspiration from early work in volume rendering and propose a hierarchical representation that increases rendering efficiency by allocating samples proportionally to their expected effect on the final rendering. 

Instead of just using a single network to represent the scene, we simultaneously optimize two networks: one coarse and one fine. We first sample a set of $N_c$ locations using stratified sampling, and evaluate the coarse network at these locations. 

With an either/or mindset, it is tempting to make one of the poles wrong or bad. A both/and mindset sees nothing bad about either pole, only potential overuses, because the poles actually need each other to exist.
