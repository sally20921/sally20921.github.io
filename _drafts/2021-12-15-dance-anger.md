<h2> The Challenge of Anger </h2>

Anger is a signal, and one worth listening to. Our anger may be a message that we are being hurt, that our rights are being violated, that our needs or wants are not being adequately met, or simply that something is not right. Our anger may tell us that we are not addressing an important emotional issue in our lives, or that too much of our self-our beliefs, values, desires, or ambitions-is being compromised in a relationship.

Our anger may be a signal that we are doing more and giving more than we can comfortably do or give. Or our anger may warn us that others are doing too much for us, at the expense of our own competence and growth. Just as physical pain tells us to take our hand off the hot stove, the pain of our anger preserves the integrity of our self. Our anger can motivate us to say "no" to the ways in which we are defined by others and "yes" to the dictates of our inner self. 

Anger is something we feel. It exists for a reason and always deserves our respect and attention. We all have a right to everything we feel-and certainly anger is no exception. There are questions about anger, however, that maybe helpful to ask ourselves: "What am I really angry about?" "What is the problem, and whose problem is it?" "How can I sort out who is responsible for what?" "How can I learn to express my anger in a way that will not leave me feeling helpless or powerless?" "When I'm angry, how can I clearly communicate my position without becoming defensive or attacking?" 

There is, however, another side of the coin: If feeling angry signals a problem, venting anger does not solve it. Venting anger may serve to maintain, and even rigidify, the old rules and patterns in a relationship, thus ensuring that change does not occur. When emotional intensity is high, many of us engage in nonproductive efforts to change the other person, and in so doing, fail to exercise our power to clarify and change our own selves. 

Feelings of depression, low self-esteem, self-betrayal, and even self-hatred are inevitable when we fight but continue to submit to unfair circumstances, when we complain but live in a way that betrays our hopes, values and potentials, or when we find ourselves fulfilling society's stereotype of the bitchy, nagging, bitter or destructive woman. Those of us who are locked into ineffective expressions of anger suffers as deeply as those of us who dare not get angry at all. 

<h2> Old Moves, New Moves, and Countermoves </h2>

Barbara is unclear about her own contribution to her dilemma. She sacrifices her own growth to bolster and protect her husband. She preserves the status quo in her marriage at the expense of her own self. She avoids testing how much flexibility her marriage has to tolerate change on her part. She feels helpless and powerless. She turns anger into tears. 

Carry on as she may, Barbara does not challenge the basic rule in the relationship-that her husband makes the rules. She "de-selfs" herself for her man. What is "de-selfing?" When two people live under the same roof, differences inevitably arise which require compromise, negotiation, and give and take. 

Problem occurs when one person-often a wife-does more giving in and going along than is her share and does not have a sense of clarity about her decisions and control over her choices. De-selfing means that too much of one's self (including one's thoughts, wants, beliefs, and ambitions) is "negotiable" under pressures from the relationship. 

Even when the person doing the most compromising of self is not aware of it, de-selfing takes its inevitable toll. The partner who is doing the most sacrificing of self stores up the most repressed anger and is especially vulnerable to becoming depressed and developing other emotional problems. She may end up in a therapist's office, or even in a medical or psychiatric hospital, saying, "What is wrong with me?" rather than asking, "What is wrong with this relationship?" Or she may express her anger, but at inappropriate times, or over petty issues, in a manner that may invite others to ignore her or to view her as irrational or sick.

A form of de-selfing, common to women, is called "underfunctioning." THe "underfunctioning-overfunctioning" pattern is a familiar one in couples. Research in marital systems has demonstrated that when women and men pair up, and stay paired up, they are usually at the same level of "independence," or emotional maturity. Like a seesaw, it is the underfunctioning of one individual that allows for the overfunctioning of the other. 

A wife, for example, may become increasingly entrenched in the role of the weak, vulnerable, dependent, or otherwise dysfunctional partner. Her husband, to the same degree, may disown and deny these qualities in himself. He may begin to direct the bulk of his emotional energy toward reacting to his spouse's problems, rather than identifying and sharing his own. 

The more the man avoids sharing his own weaknesses, neeediness, and vulnerability, the more his woman may experience and express more than her share. The more woman avoids showing her competence and strength, the more her man will have an inflated sense of his own. And if the underfunctioning partner starts looking better, the overfunctioning partner will start looking worse. 
What is important is that being at the bottom of the seesaw relationship is culturally prescribed for women. While individual women may defy or even reverse the prescription, it in fact underlies our very definitions of "femininity" and the whole ethos of male dominance. Women are actively taught to cultivate and express those qualities that men fear in themselves and do not wish to be "weakened" by. 

Sure enough, those old dictates to "play dumb," "let the man win," or "pretend he's the boss"-are out of vogue. But their message still remains a guiding rule that lurks in the unconscious of countless women: The weaker sex must protect the stronger sex from recognizing the strength of the weaker sex lest the stronger sex feel weakened by the strength of the weaker sex. We learn to act weaker to help men feel stronger and to strengthen men by relinquishing our own strength. 

Underlying her various complaints lurks the unconscious conviction that she must remain in a position of relative weakness for her most important relationship to survive. If the woman is further convinced that she herself cannot survive without the relationship, she will-like Barbara-vent her anger in a manner that only reinforces the old familiar patterns from which her anger stems. 

<h3> Ineffective Blaming Versus Assertive Claiming </h3>

How does fighting and blaming actually serve to block rather than facilitate change? There are two problems with her efforts to change her husband's mind: First, he has as much right to his opinions and speculations about the workshop as she has to hers. 

By engaging in a battle that she could only lose, she failed to exercise the power that she really did have-the power to take charge of her own self. Barbara would have taken a significant step of her de-selfed position had she clarified her own priorities and taken action on her behalf. She might have refused to fight entirely and instead said to her husband, "Good or bad, radical or not, the workshop is important to me. If I cancel my registration because you want me to, I will end up feeling angry and resentful. I look forward to the workshop and I plan to go."

Many of us who fight ineffectively, like those of us who don't fight at all, have an unconscious belief that the other person would have a very hard time if we were clear and strong. Our anxiety and guilt about the potential loss of a relationship may make it difficult for us to change in the first place-and then to stay on course when our partner reacts strongly to our new and different behavior.

<h3> Making Changes-Taking Chances </h3>

What if Barbara did something different and clarified a new position with her husband? What if she approached him at a time when he would be most receptive to hearing her and stated her position firmly and calmly without anger or tears? For instance: "I know that you don't think the workshop is worth the money and I appreciate that this is your opinion. However, I'm a grown woman and I need to make my own decisions. I don't expect you to approve of the workshop or to be happy about my going, but I do need to make this decision for myself."

Let us imagine that Barbara could stand firm on the real issue here ("I will make my own decisions") and avoid getting sidetracked into arguing other points, such as the value of the workshop or my character and credentials. Let us supppose that without fighting, blaming, accusing, or trying to change her husband's mind, she simply held her to her statement of what she wanted to do: "Right or wrong, good or bad, I need to make this choice for myself." 

What next? What would happen to this couple if Barbara challenged the status quo by calmly asserting her decision to attend the workshop? What would her husband's next move be? One thing, however, is certain: Whenever one person makes a move to rebalance the seesaw, there is a countermove by the other party. 

If Barbara behaved in this new way, her husband would make some "Change back!" manuevers as an attempt to reduce his own anxiety and reinstate the old familiar patterns of fighting. Such a manuever would occur not because he no longer loved his wife or because he was intimidated by this particular workshop, but because he felt threatened by the new level of assertiveness, separateness, and maturity that Barbara was demonstrating. 

Barbara's new position would be a statement that it is her responsibility, not his, to make decisions about what she will and will not do. In calmly and firmly clarifying this important issue in the relationship, she would no longer be the same woman whom he married and with whom he feels comfortable and secure. 

She, too, would be feeling very anxious and uncertain if she behaved in this new and different way. There are few things more anxiety-arousing than shifting to a higher level of self-assertion and separateness in an important relationship and maintaining this position despite the countermoves of the other person.

The price she will pay for starting to use the same anger energy to clarify her choices and take new actions on her own behalf is that her marriage, at least for a while, will likely be rougher than ever. She may start asking herself some serious questions: "Who is responsible for making decisions about my life?" "How are power and decision-making shared in this relationship?" "What will happen in my marriage if I become stronger and more assertive?" "If my choice is either to sacrifice myself to keep the marriage calm, or to grow and risk losing the relationship, which do I want?"

<h3> Peace at Any Price </h3>

A woman avoids conflict by defining her own wishes and preferences as being the same as what her partner wishes and prefers her to be. She defines her own self as he defines her. She sacrifices her awareness of who she is in her efforts to conform to his wants and expectations. The entire de-selfing process goes on unconsciously so that she may experience herself in perfect harmony with her husband. If she develops emotional or physical problems, she may not associate her dysfunction with the self-sacrifice that she has made in order to protect another person or keep a relationship calm. 
"It's not worth the fight" is a familiar phrase that protects many of us from confronting the challenge and changing our behavior. As Barbara's situation illustrates, fighting per se is not the issue. What matters is the degree to which we are able to take a clear position in a relationship and behave in ways that are congruent with our stated beliefs.

<h3> Separation and Togetherness </h3>

Making a long-term relationship work is a difficult business because it requires the capacity to strike a balance between individualism (the "I") and togetherness (the "we"). The tugs in both directions are very strong. On the other hand, we want to be separate, independent individuals-self-contained persons in our own right; on the other, we seek a sense of connectedness and intimacy with another person, as well as a sense of belongingness to a family or a group. When a couple gets out of balance in either direction, there is a problem. 

What happens if there is not enough "we" in our relationship? The result may be a case of "emotional divorce." Two people can end up isolated and alone in an empty-shell marriage where they do not share personal feelings and experiences. When the "separateness force" is overriding, an "I-don't-need-you" attitude may be expressed by one or both partners-a stance that is far cry from a truly autonomous position. There may be little fighting in a relationship, but little closeness as well. 

What happens if there is not enough "I" in our relationship? Here, we sacrifice our clear and separate identity and our sense of responsibility for, and control over, our own life. When the "togetherness force" is overriding, a lot of energy goes into trying to "be for" the other person, and trying to make the other person think or behave differently. Instead of taking responsibility for our own selves, we tend to feel responsible for the emotional well-being of other person and hold the other person responsible for ours. 

When this reversal of individual responsibility is set in motion, each partner may become emotionally reactive to what the other says or does, and there may be a lot of fighting and blaming, as in Barbara's case. We all need to have both an "I" and "we" that nourish and give meaning to each other. If we are chronically angry or bitter in a particular relationship, that may be a message to clarify and strengthen the "I" a bit more. 

We must re-examine our own selves with a view toward discovering what we think, feel, and want and what we need to do differently in our lives. The more we carve out a clear and separate "I," the more we can experience and enjoy both intimacy and aloneness. Our intimacy need not be "sameness" or "oneness" or loss of self; our aloneness and separateness need not be distance and isolation. 

<h3> Clarity and Fear of Loss </h3>

The woman who sits at the bottom of the seesaw marriage accumulates a great amount of rage, which is direct proportion to the degree of her submission and sacrifice. The dilemma is that we may unconsciously be convinced that our important relationships can survive only if we continue to remain one down. 

To do better-to become clearer, to act stronger, to be more separate, to take action on our own behalf-may be unconsciously equated with a destructive act that will diminish and threaten our partner, who might then retaliate or leave. Sometimes to develop a stronger "I" is to come to terms with our deep-seated wish to leave an unsatisfactory marriage, and this possibility may be no less frightening than the fear of being left. 

Fighting and blaming is sometimes a way both to protest and protect the status quo when we are not quite ready to make a move in one direction or another. We meet with a countermove or "Change back!" reaction from the other person whenever we begin to make clear statements about the needs, wants, beliefs, and priorities of the self.
