You do not need this deal, because to be needy is to lose control and make bad decisions. The self-image of the individual in the selling role traps him or her in a neediness mode and often leads to bad deals.

When the neediness is well established, they lower the boom with changes, exceptions, and a lot more-demands for concessions, all of them. There's another word for all that early chutzpah and ego on my part: neediness, plain and simple. In that negotiation with my instructor, I needed to be a top gun, to know it all, to be right. Sometimes neediness is blatant and easy to spot, but more often it is subtle and insidous. 

Talking can be an overt showing of need. THis is why no talking is one of my rules. Talking and showing need go hand in hand. He needed to feel important. This is a common issue that hard-driving, alpha-male types have to deal with daily: they want to know it all, they want to be seen to know it all. The adrenaline kicks in, the neediness becomes a biochemical fact, then the neediness becomes a biochemical addiction. 

She needed to make sure that you understood how busy she was, how competent she must be, and how lucky you would be if she could spare you the time of day. You have no great expectations, that's for sure, and your discipline is keen. Tom's blood is racing, but he might be better off with a cold call than a reference like this one. If he's not careful, he'll lose discipline, start thinking about the payday, get excited, become needy. 

When emotions run hot and heavy in negotiations, the high-pitched voicce is a sure sign of need. The rushed delivery is another sure sign. While needy negotiators raise their voices, negotiators under control lower their voices. So lower your voice in times of inner turmoil. Slow down. 

Fear of rejection is a sign of neediness-specifically, the need to be liked. Your adversaries in a negotiation cannot reject you. There's nothing you need from them, so how can they reject you? It's impossible. 

The serious negotiator understands that he or she cannot go out into the world spending emotional energy in the effort to be liked, to be smart, to be important. This negotiator wants to be recognized as being effective and businesslike, that's all. She spends her energy on the task of business. She has no need for the rest of it. 

They leak information, bring back false information, break their team's resolve, urge unnecessary compromises-all because their neediness to be smart, to be liked, to be important, is turned against them by the clever adversary. 

In a negotiation, decisions are 100 percent emotional. You don't worry about the long-term relatiohnship. You are not responsible for the other party's decisions. You don't care whether this contract is win-win. Such scorekeeping is suddenly seen for what it is: arbitrary, empty, meaningless. You don't have to worry about it anymore, and this freedom will liberate you in a negotiation, believe me. 

Often, you want to create a vision in the other party that will move them to take action. Mission and purpose drives vision for all parties, and vision drives effective decision making for all parties. In short, you may want your adversaries to see and decide. From what perspective will they see and decide? From the perspective of their own world, of course. Therefore your mission and purpose must be set in their own world-the key criterion for a valid mission and purpose. 

We start off with a good interrogative-led question but then answer it for the adversary, or at least throw out possible answers. I ask, "What is the biggest challenge you face?" and before you have a chance to answer I add, "Is it the national economy or your local labor problems?" One mistake on top of another: we answered the question for our adversary and in doing so our interrogative-led question turned into a verb-led question. 

In any negotiation, the reverse assures that you're dealing with an important question for you, thereby allowing you to gather more insight and information. Your job is to get information from the adversary by asking questions, not to provide information by answering questions. Questions and reversing help us get into the world of adversary. They are the way we create vision.

You're satisfying the necessity of answering, but the information you're giving is, for all intents and purposes, not worth much. Most of the time, however, your adversary will not recognize this, will accept the answer, and will be open to a good question from you. 

You have to make certain that the agreement you're hearing from the adversary on this particular is truly agreement. As always, you're extremely suspicious of yes. Most of all you cannot sound needy to nail down this point of agreement. The 3+ technique cannot seem to the adversary like pressure in any way; it cannot be pressure in any way. When you use 3+, you always have to leave the option for the adversary to change his mind. You are not rushing to close three times. You're asking for no three times. That's the way to think about it. 

We always give the adversaries the opportunity to go through this process in their own minds. The 3+ technique goes hand in hand with "never close". The whole point of 3+ is to give the adversary multiple opportunities to look at their decision-to verify it, to justify it, or to change it. We give the adversary every chance to think through the situation, look at it from different perspectives, and see for themselves how their thinking changes. The adversary doesn't always see what they should see, and using the 3+ technique helps them get a good picture. No vision, no decision. 

That's what a negotiation can be like. Initially, the pendulum is stationary. Emotions are calm, neither positive or negative. Then something happens, someone says something, and this force pushes the pendulum into the negative, say. Then some factor halts the movement into the negative and pulls the pendulum all the way past neutral and toward positive. All these back-and-forth emotional swings can be catastrophic to the negotiation, especially if they're big and dramatic. The task of the good negotiator is to keep the pendulum as close as possible to a calm, stationary mode. The big negative swings don't do anyone any good in the long run, and neither do the big positive swings.

If you, the salesperson, allow the potential customer to swing too hard into the positive mode, what happens when the inevitable second thoughts and doubts set in? The pendelum that was high in the positive mode swings down with so much momentum it carries all the way through neutral and into the hard negative mode. These big swings are a vicious cycle, so to speak, and they're almost impossible to control. But you must maintain control. So what's the solution? It's simple: avoid both the strongly negative and the strongly positive by staying in the calm neutral range, which is where we find the deals that stick. 

You mean we don't want the adversary to get all excited about this deal? No, we don't, because the excitement won't last; those inevitable second thoughts will come along sooner or later. 

But positive expectations are so positive. They feel so good. Who doesn't want to be hopeful? Positive attitude sounds great, but to me it's just another, more seductive way of saying positive expectations. For the negotiator, even a positive attitude is dangerous. Yes, it's true. It can devolve quickly into neediness, into positive expectations. When I teach blank slate, I mean blank slate. And it's hard. 

The trained negotiator, meanwhile, has no thoughts either way about the final price for the machine. The trained negotiator recognizes those early numbers for what they are: early numbers of no real significance. 

Neither positive nor negative expectations have a place in my system. You blank slate and you negotiate, that's all. Expectations are everywhere. In this regard, they're like emotions. In fact, they are emotions. You cannot banish them once and for all, but you can see them for what they are and take appropriate measures. It's easy to get excited and tempting to let your emotions take over. When you feel this happening, call a time-out, take a bathroom break, or suggest a break for coffee or for lunch, or step back in some other way.

Now what about assumptions, the other chief of obstacle to effective blank slating? They're just as dangerous as positive and negative expectations, and just as common, because most of us come to believe that we're pretty good at reading other people, at understanding what they're really feeling and thinking. 

There are just a million assumptions out there, lying in wait to ambush us. We're all vulnerable to assumptions, despite the fact that we can all identify ones that have been flat-out wrong. The results of these assumptions-delusions might be better word in this context-were tragic. 

I needed to see your picture of the horse, not my picture. Forget my picture. It doesn't matter at all. But all too often we make this very mistake. It doesn't matter at all. Any one of us could sit down in the evening for ten minutes and make a list of assumptions we made that day. Assumptions are like expectations in that we can't get rid of them, but as good negotiators we can beware of them. 

The lack of information makes it easy to assume and almost impossible to blank slate. Not knowing about something, you have the urge to fill in the blanks with the first thing that pops into your mind. You wing it, so to speak. 

If you're overly tired, it's difficult to focus. If you're dealing with the remains of the night before, blank slating is difficult. If there's a crisis in your home, blank slating can be impossible. If you feel like you cannot blank slate for any reason, you have only one option: cancel the negotiation session. This is how important the blank slate is.  

To begin with, you're asking your adversary to come into your world and see your world. And where do we want to spend our time in negotiation? In the adversary's world. Second, if we're busy giving reasons to our adversary, we're too busy talking; we're totally in our world and impeding our ability to blank slate. Finally, and most important of all, we're forgetting that decisions are made not with our head but with our heart and guts, first of all. Remember, negotiations are 100 percent emotional until a decision is made. 

And being unokay, not needing, blank slating, painting pain-these are all principles of valid behavior. We want to keep our own budgets as low as possible while reaping the benefit of the adversary's higher budget. Professional negotiators must carefully consider the value of time, but usually this calculation just doesn't enter our minds. To the untrained negotiator, time is a virtually free commodity given away right and left, so he ends up spending his commission, in effect, in time-and-energy. 

For the crafty negotiator, increasing the adversary's time budget is the oldest game in the book: making you wait an hour, flooding you with e-mails and faxes, asking you to drive two hours or fly eight hours, canceling at the last minute. The higher the pain, the higher the budget. People will pay a much higher price than you would ever ask. 

For your own part, make certain that you do have all the time in the world-and if you don't, be ready to walk away. Remember, you only want this deal, you do not need this deal. They may now need this deal The work of negotiating is draining, and we really don't have any energy to waste. We want it to be there  

Every call and e-mail has some kind of purpose, doesn't it? I hope so. So what's the purpose? The agenda makes it clear. Furthermore, a presentation shows neediness, doesn't it? I'll bet you agree that otherwise effective negotiations have survived formal presentations, but they have never needed them. There must be some reason why you invited me to this meeting. You must have some interest in something about Widgets International. I just need an idea what it is. 

Like all predators, we humans often take advantage of the fear-racked, the distressed, the vulnerable, the needy. In your life as a negotiator, even in your life as a private citizen of the world, you are dealing with some serious predators who are looking for the slightest sign of distress and neediness. 

You do not need this deal, because to be needy is to lose control and make bad decisions. How vulnerable are you to predators when you lose control? Very vulnerable. He has always known and never forgotten that the lion is a predator, first and foremost, and will behave like a predator when given the opportunity and sensing weakness. Every animal in the trainer knows the same thing: with a predator, it's all about power.

The self-image of the individual in the selling role traps him or her in a neediness mode and often leads to bad deals. Tough negotiators are experts at recognizing this neediness in their adversaries, and expert in creating it as well. Negotiators with giant corporations, in particular, will heighten the expectations of their supplier adversaries, painting rosy, exaggerated scenarios for mega-orders, joint ventures, global alliances, all for the purpose of building neediness on the part of their adversary for this once-in-a-lifetime, career-making deal. Then, when the neediness is well established, they lower the boom with changes, exceptions, and a lot more-demands for concessions, all of them. 

Sometimes they really were desperate for horses and other supplies. Today, in the twenty-first century, we're not needy. We use the word need much too casually. The only thing we truly need are the basics of physical survival. It should not include this particular job or sale or deal, because there are other jobs and sales and deals. 
 
These extreme emotions are fine. They're mandatory for fun. For negotiators, they're dangerous. Emotions have an extremely high value in any negotiation. The value of the negotiation increases by many multiples when emotional pain or excitement is invested. 

The excitement of winning and the pain of losing, of failing, are the two key emotions for both you and your adversary, and sophisticated corporate negotiating teams are trained to drive up your emotional budget-as well as the other two budgets, of course-with promises, threats, ridiculous requests and deadlines, sudden exclamations that the deal has gone south, and the like. But you must control your needs, your positive and negative expectations, your fears, your ego, your responses, and your decisions. You must not expect to manage the actual wins or losses, because you can't do this. You can only manage the means to the end: stay within your system, manage your activity, manage your behavior. This is all the armor you need. At the same time, you build needs, expectations, fears and egos in the adversary in order to increase the value of the negotiation for him. 

Know your budget. Control your budget. Know their budget. Build their budget. These rules apply for time-and-energy, for money, for emotions. When you master them, you really can't fail. 

There's another word for all that early chutzpah and ego on my part: neediness, plain and single. In that negotiation with my instructor, I needed to be a top gun, to know it all, to be right. Sometimes neediness is blatant and easy to spot, as in that flying story, but more often it is subtle and insidious. The trained negotiator sees neediness of all sorts all the time, in big ways and in little ways. It is so easy to slip into such state, often without even being aware of it. 

I'm not quite sure that we as a venture fund firt where you're going, I just don't know. What I'd like to do is meet with you so we can see where you're going and you can look at where we're going and see if there's a fit. When's the best time on your calendar?

Talking can be an overt showing of need. This is why no talking is one of my rules-an exaggeration of course, but I make it a rule to make a point: talking and showing need go hand in hand. He needed to feel important. Okay, thought his shrewder adversaries, we'll happy to let you feel important as we skin you alive. This is common issue that hard-driving, alpha-male types have to deal with daily: they want to know it all, short of that, they want to be seen to know it all. The adrenaline kicks in, the neediness becomes a biochemical fact, then the neediness becomes a biochemical addiction.

She needed to make sure you understood how busy she was, how competent she must be, how lucky you would be if she could spare you the time of day. But it's all counterproductive. It's just annoying.

If he's not careful, he'll lose discipline, start thinking about the payday, get excited, become needy. 
When emotions run hot and heavy in negotiations, the high-pitched voice is a sure sign of need. The rushed delivery is another sure sign. While needy negotiators raise their voices, negotiators under control lower their voices. So lower your voice in times of inner turmoil. Slow down.
 
I wasn't needy. She was. She would have shown no need while building my need. Fear of rejection is a sign of neediness-specifically, the need to be liked. It is imperative for the negotiator to understand just what rejection is, and who can reject you and who cannot. Here's the key point: your adversaries in a negotiation cannot reject you. There's nothing you need from them, so how can they reject you? It's impossible. 

Fear of rejection is a sign of neediness-specifically, the need to be liked. It is imperative for the negotiator to understand what rejection is, and who can reject you and who cannot. Your adversaries in a negotiation cannot reject you. There's nothing you need from them, so how can they reject you? It's impossible. They don't have any such power. Never, never allow them to believe that they do.

The serious negotiator understands that he or she cannot go out into the world spending emotional energy in the effort to be liked, to be smart, to be important. This negotiator wants to be recognized as being effective and businesslike, that's all. She spends her energy on the task of business. She has no need for the rest of it. But how often we fall into this particular neediness trap. A key tactic of management is to find union members who want a boost to the ego and can therefore be made to feel needy. They leak valuable information, bring back false information, break their team's resolve, urge unnecessary compromises-all because their neediness to be smart, to be liked, to be important, is turned against them by the clever adversary. 

Their CEO was wary precisely because the company that was now my client had compromised too much. Something must be wrong, he thought, for a company to show so much need. That cannot be a competent, trustworthy compancy. They'll never be able to deliver. My new clinet would never have been able to make good on the commitments negotiated in that deal. 

When the distance to the prey begins to widen, the hunter quits. She will never waste energy on a losing cause. She saunters off, because it doesn't matter. These are othe wildbeests, other gazelles. Likewise, the trained negotiator has no needs, because it just doesn't matter. There are other deals. Turn the page on this one. Let it go.

The context was a discussion of the dangers of win-win, and how win-win implicitly urges you to focus on what you cannot control-the end-while losing sight of what you can control-the means. Now I'll add the point that urgent closing betrays neediness on your part. You need to close. 

No, you don't. But maybe your adversary does. If there's any need in this negotiation it has to be your adversary's, not yours. We negotiators-we humans-show our neediness in many, many ways. To recognize your own varieties, all you really have to do is stop and think about what you're doing and what the underlying motivation is. No one knows better than you when your neediness is showing its true colors. When you stop to consider, it's amazing how much in our lives that we get so worked up over doesn't matter, not really. 

As a negotiator aspiring to excellence, you must, at all costs, avoid showing need. You do not need this deal. But what happens if we simply substitute the word and the emotion want for need? The dynamics change. As good negotiators, the word want means something we work for, strive for, plan for, but it is never confused with need. It will be their loss, not mine, if any of these deals falls through. Either way, I'll sleep tonight and I'll eat tomorrow. 

He had the habit of forgetting to ask a key question in every interview and interrogation. He'd have to ring the doorbell again, apologize, and ask that final question. He always presented himself to his adversaries as a little less competent than they were; a little less perfect-or, usually, a lot less perfect. He could get people to talk to him because he made them feel superior and therefore comfortable. 

Maybe our strength is our knowledge, or physical beauty, or charming personality. Maybe we're cunning and fearless, or quick of wit. Whatever our strength, that is what we build on. This is what we need to show the world. 

When we are with people we think we are ahead of, or at least equal to, we feel comfortable. In the presence of people to whom we feel inferior, we feel unokay and can become defensive, or aggressive, or resentful, or a lot of other emotions. 

Have you noticed how we humans tend to feel okay when we see someone not okay? We feel comfortable when we see someone who doesn't quite measure up in some way. Soap opera fans watch the shows because the lives of the characters in those stories are even more messed up than the viewers' own lives. 

The wise negotiator knows that only person in a negotiation can feel okay, and that person is the adversary. By allowing him to feel in control, you are actually in control. We're all in this boat together. We're all humans. We've made a mistake today and we'll make another one tomorrow, very possibly a whopper. People who pretend otherwise fool no one but themselves. 

Our greatest strength is our greatest weakness. How true. We tend to overplay our hand, so to speak, but as negotiators we must control this instinct while letting it blossom in our adversary. If he likes to show off his glibness, let him. If he can't resist the opportunity to play to his charm, let him. If he likes to demonstrate his extraordinary grasp of the finest points of federal law, let him. The trained negotiator is more than happy to let the adversary show off in almost any way he wants to, because that adversary's greatest strength will eventually become his greatest weakness. 

We are so incompetent and so weak in negotiating, that we have been a poor supplier. We have put you in a terrible position, and we apologize for that. We take responsibility for our eneptness in negotiation. This helped to disarm the adversary. Nor was it unprofessional to make such an admission. 

Do you enjoy being around the perfect person? I don't. People want to deal with a regular person. Struggle a little. Letting people help you is an excellent way to help them feel more okay. The tougher the negotiation, the more critical it is to understand that if someone in this room has to be unokay, it will be you and not your adversary. When your adversary feels unokay, the barriers go up much faster than you can break them down. But unokayness on your part breaks down barriers. The next time you find yourself in a situation in which your adversary is maybe just a little stand-offish or doubtful, try being a little less okay. 

In a negotiation, decisions are 100 percent emotional. Yes, 100 percent. Research psychologists have proved this beyond any doubt. Because facts do not win negotiations. Facts come later, because they mean nothing to the stomach. Negotiations are indeed rooted in emotions, and all too often never get beyond them. Your job as a negotiator is to see them clearly and overcome them with precise decision making. 

Negotiations really does start with no, not with maybe, definitely not with yes, but with a firm, clear no. Because no is a real decision that induces the party across the table into actually thinking about why they've just said no. The responsibility of making a clear decision hleps the adversary focus on the real issues of the negotiation. 

The mere invitation for the other side to say no changes the dynamic of a negotiation in a very beneficial way. But the alternative answers-maybe and yes-aren't real decisions at all. They do nothing at all to stop the ebb and flow of emotions. They're just a frustrating waste of time. Let's see why. 

And the moment we're needy, we've lost control. Offering an early yes is a real tiger trick. It traps us in his cage. Shrewd corporate negotiators use this trick all the time. 

No gets the adversary across the table into a rational mode. Just thinking about saying no gets the adversary into the rational mode. Because one company was willing to risk losing the deal rather than compromise further, the multinational's negotiators found themselves at a severe disadvantage. 

Feel free to say no. Turn us down at any point. The negotiation would have proceeded much more quickly. Essential issues, not emotional ones, would have been on the table early. Neither side would have been in a guessing mode. We want decision-based negotiation, not the emotion-based waste of time known as win-win. 

All the while urging the Japanese to just say no if they felt they had to. Our agreement must change, my clients said, but tell us no if this new one doesn't work for you. The invitation to say no crystallized their thinking. It got their attention. As it was, the invitation to say no led directly, inexorably, to a deal. 

To my knowledge, corporate America had never once said, "No, we don't think so, we believe in a fair profit for our business. Feel free to say no to us in return, but we're not giving you a good piece of our business for nothing. That's not a good practice for us and our investors." Inviting the Koreans at every opportunity to say no. Finally my clients said they would be leaving the following morning, and very politely gave the Koreans one last chance to say no and be done with it. 

To the coaches at the schools in which he was interested, this student sent his academic transcript along with a letter requesting that the recruiter please advise him if he was not academically qualified. That was a straightforward "tell me no" request. The player didn't want to waste his time with a school for which he was not qualified. He followed up with a second request for certain coaches to tell him no. To them he wrote, "Please tell me if you're not going to support my application through the admissions process. I'd appreciate knowing this now, because if you cannot support me, I'll move on to the other schools I'm interested in."

The easiest way to accomplish both these goals-finding out where he stood and getting the coach on his side-was to ask the coach to say no. 

The need to be liked plays a tremendous role in shaping people's personalities, impacting upon important decisions related to relationships, work, and hobbies, causing emotional and behavioral problems, and ultimately influencing our quality of life. However, this fundamental human need often operates in more subtle ways than you might think. 

The need to be liked is a fundamental human need. Everyone has fundamental needs, which impact their lives in significant ways. Thus, relative to physical threat cues, things can get a bit more complicated with rejection cues because of the ambiguity involved.
