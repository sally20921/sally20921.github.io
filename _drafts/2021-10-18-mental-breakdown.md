Hence the division between the romantics and the realists. Hidden behind this question looms a secret longing for the vital, the surge of erotic energy that marks our aliveness. Whatever safety and security people have persuaded themselves to settle for, they still very much want this force in their lives. Can we both love and desire in the same relationship over time? 

In fact, security and passion are two separate, fundamental human needs that springs from different motives and tend to pull us in different directions. We're walking contradictions, seeking safety and predictability on one hand and thriving on diversity on the other. 

This never ending dance between change and stability is like the anchor and the waves. Desire is fueled by the unknown, and for that reason it's inherently anxiety-producing. Eroticism resides in the ambiguous space between anxiety and fascination. 

Sexual excitement requires the capacity not to worry, and the pursuit of pleasure demands a degree of selfishness. The very caring he experiences makes it harder for him to focus on his own needs, to feel spontaneous, sexually alive, and carefree. Being close doesn't mean never fighting. 

But when we reduce sex to a function, we also invoke the idea of dysfunction. We are no longer talking about the art of sex; rather, we are talking about the mechanics of sex.

You can't choose between inhaling and exhaling; you have to do both. It's the same thing with intimacy and passion. I explain to Ben that the tension between security and adventure is a paradox to manage, not a problem to solve. Love and desire are two rhythmic yet clashing forces that are always in a state of flux and always looking for the balance point. 

When we confuse assertion with aggression, neutralize otherness, adjust our longings, and reason away our hostility, we assemble a calmness that is reassuring but not very exciting. The degradation of romance, the waning of desire, is due not to the contamination of love by aggression, but to the inability to sustain the necessary tension between them. 

Even when we are the ones with an issue to raise, sometimes doing less is actually doing more. This is in part about waiting for an opportune time to raise our concerns, but it is also a matter of waiting for an issue to mature, so that it becomes clear that a discussion of the problem is necessary and so that the exact nature of the issue comes into focus. 

What often happens at this stage, according to Newburg's subjects, is that they believed that if they could work harder, they could win. Running into an obstacle, they redoubled their efforts and worked harder. Frequently this created a vicious cycle: work harder, setback, work harder, setback. 

I believe win-win is hopelessly misguided as a basis for good negotiating, in your business or in your personal life or anywhere else. I think it's astonishing that top executives don't understand that it is precisely the win-win negotiation that are grinding their businesses to the ground. I began to challenge win-win because I quickly learned that it's all too often win-lose. 

What is the poison that resides at the heart of the big lie that is win-win? You've heard of the deadly stuff. It's called compromise. 

Another rule is no closing. But this is absurd, you may think. After all, how to close is a more or less mandatory section of almost every negotiation book, so it has to be important. But I'm not playing games. Larger deals, and even smaller ones, don't close in the usual sense of term. They come together through vision and decision, over weeks and months and maybe years.

Like all predators, we humans often take advantage of the fear-racked, the distressed, the vulnerable, the needy. Tough negotiators are experts at recognizing the neediness in their adversaries, and expert in creating it as well. Then, when the neediness is well-established, they lower the boom with changes, and a lot more-demands for concessions, all of them.  

As good negotiators, the word want means something we work for, strive for, plan for, but it is never confused with need. Sure I want the car, but I don't need it. I want the house, but I don't need it. It will be their loss, not mine, if any of these deals fall through. Either way, I'll sleep tonight and I'll eat tomorrow.

The wise negotiator knows that only one person in a negotiation can feel okay, and that person is the adversary. By letting your adversary be a little okay, you start to bring down barriers. By allowing him to feel in control, you are actually in control. 

I am not suggesting that you appear unprofessional. I'm asking you not to be afraid of candor and honesty, not to be afraid of not being totally okay, of being less than perfect. Do you enjoy being around the perfect person? I don't. People want to deal with a regular person. 

Our so-called rational mind kicks in only after we've made the decision, in order to justify it after the fact. Successful negotiation requires the complete understanding and application of this dynamic of decision making. 

The negotiation really does start with no-not with maybe, definitely not with yes, but with a firm, clear no. In any negotiation, this is the key word I want to hear. Everything that precedes it is mere window dressing.

How can this be? Because no is a real decision that induces the party across the table into actually thinking about why they've just said no. The responsibility of making a clear decision helps the adversary focus on the real issues of the negotiation. The adversary has to take responsibility for no, so now everyone has something real to talk about. The mere invitation for the other side to say no changes the dynamic of a negotiation in a very beneficial way. 

I cannot emphasize this point too strongly: maybe is the kiss of death for a successful negotiation. Sometimes the adversary is so conditioned by the getting to yes ethos that she starts out with yes. But a yes in the beginning is no better than a maybe. It is not a decision, not really, because your adversary can't really be mean yes. If she did, everyone wouldn't be here negotiating in the first place.

The moment we're needy, we've lost control. We know in our head that this yes isn't real and final, but the emotion in our heart surges nevertheless. The other side is suddenly in control. Offering an early yes is a real tiger trick. It traps us in his cage. Shrewd corporate negotiators use this trick all the time. 

As I said, no gets the adversary across the table into a rational mode. Just thinking about saying no gets the adversary into a rational mode. Essential issues, not emotional ones, would have been on the table early. Neither side would have been in a guessing mode. Everyone could have been working on real problems. Time, money, resources would have been saved. 

That's the key idea here: no gets you past emotional issues and trivial issues to essential issues. We want decision-based negotiation, not the emotion-based waste of time known as win-win.

When they finally master the word the results are often magical, but for many it isn't easy to get over the hump. In the world of business, specifically, we are so immersed in the emotion-based atmosphere of win-win that saying no just sounds too harsh. We all want to be liked, we don't want to hurt someone's feelings, we don't want to come across as too blunt or surly or arrogant or demanding, we don't want to shut the door on a deal prematurely, we don't want to start a win-win negotiation on a negative note. 

Without question, one of the most dangerous mistakes you can make in a negotiation is trying to save the adversary, as I put it. Because if you do save the adversary, you are now partially responsible for their decision. Saving the adversary is but one example of the many behaviors known in negotiating circles as saving the relationship. Because of his own deeply ingrained desire for approval, he was unable to see the real problem in the negotiation. 

People take no as personal rejection. They get ugly, they go negative in a big way. And this is why saving the relationship is classic win-win behavior. The unspoken-or sometimes spoken-assumption behind win-win is that people enter negotiations trying to build friendly relationships and want to leave with the relationship intact. 

How much do I have to leave on the table in order to maintain this relationship? Bigtime corporate negotiators, along with many others, play this game to the hilt. They play up the importance of partnerships, loyalty, the long term-emotion-based stuff. But their only real concern is the price they're paying. 

Friendships with the good folks on the other side an be fine-or they can be dangerous. The impulse to think and act in any such save-the-relationship The impulse to think and act in any such save-the-relationship fashion is wrongheaded not only because it's bad negotiating, but also because the adversary across the table does not want to be a friend. 

I noted earlier in this chapter that most of us humans want to be liked, don't want to hurt feelings, don't want to be blunt or surly or arrogant. This does not mean that we want to be everybody's good friend. For businesspeople and negotiators in any field, much more important than friendliness are effectiveness and respect. Nothing more. These people don't get away with their boorish, offensive behavior for no good reason. They get away with it because they're effective in their work and bring benefit to their business relationship, in one way or another. 

Every reader can think of a case in which she or he has chosen to deal with an obnoxious but effective person rather than a friendly but ineffective one. What does friendship have to do with making good business and negotiation decisions? Not a thing. 

As will become quite clear, I advocate and coach respectful dealings and politeness with the adversary at all times. This is mandatory for my clients. But this practice has nothing to do with saving the adversary from taking responsibility for decisions, all for the sake of friendship for being liked or for feeling important. Most businesspeople will agree that friendships in business are the product of long-term effective dealings. Making decisions based on a sense that the adversary seeks your friendship is misguided. They would much prefer your effectiveness. 

Why would you want to load down a business relationship with a lot of emotional baggage, including guilt, which can be the by-product of friendship? It doesn't work. It doesn't pay. If agreements result from effective decision making, the odds are very good that there will be a long-term business relationship, regardless whether you play golf with your adversary. If agreements are the result of ineffective decision making, there won't be-and should be-a long-term relationship, no matter how many rounds you play.

The fear of hurting people's feelings, of being liked, of damaging a long-term relationship-these are all reasons we're afraid to say no. Another is that we're afraid to make a wrong decision. 

I or any businessperson could expand this list for pages. There's no doubt that the average negotiator is beset by doubt. The fear of making a wrong decision relates to all our fears of failing, which are deeply ingrained in most of us. In school we were afraid of giving a wrong answer because we'd look stupid and be laughed at by the other kids. 

In the business world, the wrong answer-the wrong decision-can have far worse ramifications. So we live in fear of that wrong decision, and that fear binds us. Unnecessary fear of a bad decision is a major stumbling block to good decision.

Digging the well is building up influence, and it's something you must do before you need to leverage it. 

I wrote this book to start the conversation we are not having, a conversation about the real story of what happens when dreams come true. Knowing the real story won't protect you from the difficulties and challenges that come with acquisition and gain and success, but it may insulate you from the corrosive doubt that something is wrong with how you got it or how fast you got there. 

I want to quell your suspicion that you failed at success, and I want you to understand that success is just as disruptive as failure, and unlike failure, that it comes without sympathy.

Once you get whatever it is you want, there's always something else to want: more and then more. Whatever your age, so it seems, you can never have enough of what you want-or already have plenty of. 

In what shouldn't have been to my surprise, I was finding myself being asked to help with what one person called the agony of victory. 

I carefully instruct my staff always to put the patient first, whether it's involving a complicated procedure in the dental chair or something simple like setting an appointment. You seem to be paying a high personal price for your kindness. 

As a people pleaser, you surely have developed, like Robert, a keen sense of responsibility, taking upon yourself the assignment of being a positive presence in a sometimes-negative world. This is a sound philosophy, yet it is also one that can lead to stress and tension if carried too far.  

Recall that two of the primary emotions experienced by people pleasers are fear and guilt. Somewhere along the way these people pick up the notion that they are doomed to be poorly judged if they do not act as others want them to act. 

Inherent in any critical message is the threat that you will be labeled as unfit or substandard or unacceptable or weak in character. Because people pleasers tend to filter their self-esteem through the pronouncement of others, the prospect of being so poorly labeled is frightening. 

Actually when you act a particular way because you fear being criticized, you are not necessarily engaging in responsible behavior. During the years of childhood development, people need to learn responsibility that is not driven by a fear of criticism. Responsible behavior is an act of initiative based on genuine convictions, not an act of fear driven by a desire to appease the judgement of others. 

How do we know we know? Where does this certainty of the rewards of success come from? All of us, more or less, count on over-the rainbow strategies, making when-then deals with ourselves throughout our lives. When I get past this project, then things will slow down and get easier. 

What would be your reaction if you were told that achieving your goal would be far more challenging and disruptive than anything you ran into trying to get it? Exactly. People don't want to hear such things. They don't want to know. They need to believe the story of what will happen because they have so much riding on it. And they don't want anyone to dis their myth. 

And, I might suggest, imagining the outcome of any of our life's big stories tends to favor happily-ever-after endings. We either can't or won't envision the changes in structure, meaning, and identity that await, lurking just of our sight. Don't dwell on the deep, dark forest, we think, and maybe it'll stay away. It seems that we all know better than to believe that things end happily ever after, but that's the story and it's sticking to us. 

To greater or lesser degrees, we all buy into the idea of the Grand Narrative of Success, or at least recognize its hold on us. We experience it from the time we envy the kid next door with the cool new bike, to the time we realize that people seem more impressed by material quests than spiritual ones, to the time we understand that size does matter when it comes to homes and boats and back accounts and portfolios.

But whatever their shortcomings, the successful people in our society are generally embraced and held up as role models and examples of what can be achieved in life-and what's possible in this land of opportunity. 

We want simple objective measures to tell us if a teacher or a school is doing a good job, so we can reward improving performance and punish performance that declines. But unfortunately, the more complicated the problem is, the less likely it is that the myth of the objective will hold true-and education is definitely a very complicated social problem. Driving progress by objectives would only make sense if the problem waas simple. 

There is more at stake than simply observing that accomplishing anything worthwhile requires at least making the attempt, while those who venture nothing can only ever avoid disappointment. Therein lies the strategy paradox: the same behaviors and characteristics that maximize a firm's probability of notable success also maximize its probability of total failure. 

Many opposites are not nearly as different as they first appear. The same neurocircuitry and neurochemistry triggered in response to stressful events (flight or fight) are also triggered in responses to sexual arousal. 

Call it an emotional paradox: two very different dispositions-loving and hating-can have far more in common with each other than a seemingly intermediate state. 

Expertise is correctly, but one-sidedly, associated with special abilities and enhanced performance. The other side of expertise, however, is surreptitiously hidden. Along with expertise, performance may also be degraded, culminating in a lack of flexibility and error. These information processing mechanisms, the very making of expertise, entail computational trade-offs that sometimes result in paradoxical functional degradation. 

An expert entails using schemas, selective attention, chunking information, automaticity and more reliance on top-down information, all of which allows experts to perform quickly and efficiently; however, these very mechanisms restrict flexibility and control, may cause the experts to miss and ignore important information, introduce tunnel vision and bias and can cause other effects that degrade performance. 

We're addicted to pursuing happiness and all that it promises. Don't worry, be happy! Once we start getting this happiness hit, in whatever form it might take, we find that it takes more and more of it for the same buzz next time. 

It's not easy to find that sweet spot where we can bring up something important without provoking an avoidant response. Finding that spot inevitably requires avoiding some elements of the conflict and focusing on others. Hard though this may be, it is essential to constructive engagement. 

The distinction between avoidance and engagement breaks down when we look at the emotional dimension. Our emotional take on a conflict influences our behavior, and vice versa-but not always in a straightforward way. 

Our emotional involvement pushes us both to engage and disengage at the same time. In other words, they want to avoid and engage simultaneously. When an emotional reaction is triggered, people's responses are often spontaneous and inconsistent. 

Sony's failures were not a consequence of bad strategy, but of great strategy coupled with bad luck. When key uncertainties broke against it, Sony became a victim of the strategy paradox. 

How does this relate to ourselves and our own behavior? How do these four motivational oppositions play out in our own lives? We are dynamic not static, fluid not fixed, dancers not statues. Such contradiction is paradoxical since it is reasonable to assume that most people would want to be consistent, and not do things at one time that might work against the things they do at another time. Why, as it were, build a sandcastle only to knock it down?

We make another decision, and then another, and then another, and then another. A negotiation is a series of decisions. When you make a bad decision, you simply follow it with a better one. Understanding this simple lesson will liberate you as a negotiator. As lon as you at least do make decisions, we can fix the bad ones. Soldier on without fear because you are only one decision away from getting back on track. This attitude and approach take discipline and a lot of self-confidence, because being right is very important to most of us. It is a powerful need, and like all needs, it must be overcome. 

Embrace no at every oppportunity in a negotiation. Don't fear the word, invite it. You do not take it as a personal rejection because you are not needy. You understand that every no is reversible. If you cannot accept no, you will burn too many bridges and have no way back into too many negotiations. Nothing is more important to a successful negotiation than for you to make as clear as possible from the very beginning that no is a perfectly acceptable response at this negotiating table. You must make clear that you do not take no as a personal rejection, but as an honest decision that can be discussed and perhaps reversed. You must make clear that a blunt no is preferable to maybe, which tells you nothing at all, and also preferable to yes, a total nonstarter. 

WHen you are able to do so, you'll be amazed how this right to say and hear no clears the air at the negotiating table. They can give you an honest no, you'll accept it gratefully, and they know you'll react in the same way in the future. Feeling safe saying no, they also feel safe hearing no. Barriers go down, trust goes up, everyone feels more comfortable, everyone becomes more forthright, we're all adults here, the atmosphere of honesty is welcome.

In the long run, no is really the safest answer. It does not tear down business relationships. It builds them. Saying and inviting and hearing no are the real win-win. 

Forget all this stuff! If your negotiation serves a valid mission and purpose, you don't have to worry about whether you get last dollar or concession out of the deal, or whether you gave enough dollars and concessions. You don't worry about the long-term relationship. You are not responsible for the other party's decisions. You don't care whether this contract is win-win, win-lose, or lose-lose. Such scorekeeping is suddenly seens for what it is: arbitrary, empty, meaningless. You don't have to worry about it anymore, and this freedom will liberate you in a negotiation, believe me.

Another problem with concentrating on money and power as a mission and purpose is that you're scorekeeping, and scorekeeping means you're thinking about results over which you have no real control. 

Make that a valid mission and purpose. First and foremost, it must be set in the adversary's world. For a businessperson, it must be set in the world of the customer. Setting the mission and purpose in the constituents' or the customer's or the adversary's world allows all of them to see clearly the features and benefits that you and your product or service have to offer them. 

My mission and purpose is to help people see, discover, and decide to experience this world as a world of imagination and possibility and healing. We do this by sharing our stories and the model of our company, in a way that is sustainable now and into the future our children will inherit.

Please take a minute or two to study the statement and absorb the fact that it's fundamentally, irrevocally set in the world of his customer. In a valid mission and purpose, our world must be secondary. You might understandably ask why, if it's my mission and purpose, do I want to focus on someone else? Because unless you live alone on a desert island, your mission and purpose is to focus on someone else. That someone else is your lifeblood. 

Over the long haul, you put profits in the bank by putting the customer first, and there's a direct analogy with negotiation: we greatly enhance our opportunity for a successful deal by putting the adversary first in our misson and purpose. 

The strategy paradox rests on two premises: commitments can not be adapted should predictions prove incorrect; and predictions are never reliably or verifiably correct. There is a greater need than ever for adaptable enterprises. Such an observation is entirely correct. Unfortunately, the acuteness of the need does not mean that it can be satisfied.

Most organizations exhibit some degree of adaptability. However, adaptability is far less useful when the pace of organizational change matches the pace of environmental change. Fast change leaves an organization's capabilities optimized for an environment that suddenly no longer exists. Slow change prompts an organization to adapt to incremental changes in the environment around it, and because these incremental adaptations, the company often fails to see the need for a more fundamental transformation. 

His valid mission and purpose was to provide the coaches with an individual who would put forth the effort required for complete team success. It was to get this director to see and decide that presenting this particular dance company would bring cultural richness to her organization's audiences and community, and to help the program director fulfill her organization's own mission and purpose. 

As an interviewee for a job, your mission and purpose might be to help the employer see and decide that you are a person of great character and integrity that the employer's company must have in order to take its business to a new level. As a commercial plumber, it might be to help contractors see and decide that you bring great benefit to their projects by providing professional workmanship, using the highest-quality supplies and materials available, and guaranteeing on-time completion. As a travel agent, it might be to help travelers see and decide that your knowledge and experience in the field and attention to detail would enhance every aspect of their travel. 

My purpose here isn't to elevate your success regardless, but simply provide you with the opportunity to do so. Often, you want to create a vision in the other party that will move them to take action. Mission and purpose drives vision for all parties, and vision drives effective decision making for all parties. In short, you may want your adversaries to see and decide. From what perspective will they see and decide? From the perspective of their own world, of course. Therefore, your mission and purpose must be set in their own world-the key criterion for a valid mission and purpose. 

One of the reasons why doubt has not been closely studied is that it is easy to confuse with fear. Doubt and fear are definitely friends, perhaps even relatives, but they are not identical twins. 

He doubted his doubt. I first became aware of this voice that undermined self-confidence when I played tennis. Even as a child I would walk out onto the court for the first time that day and there would be uncertainty. It's the first shot of the game, and they are uncertain what is going to happen. Then, based on the first few shots, either some confidence or some doubt appears. 

The first step is to acknowledge that we are not born in self-doubt. So doubt is not our original state of mind but something learned or accepted somewhere along the way. 

If I were a beginner in the study of decision-based negotiation (as opposed to emotion- and compromise-based negotiation), my initial goals would be to focus at all times on my mission and purpose, to control my neediness and never demonstrate neediness, to always allow my adversary to be okay, to have no fear of saying or hearing no. Instead of trying to break par, a result we cannot control, we concentrate on putting a good swing on the ball, an action we can control. 

As you work through these lessons and apply them to your business and your life, you'll develop a keen awareness of exactly what you can and cannot control, and therefore what is and is not a valid goal. What you can control is behavior and activity, what you cannot control is the result ofthis behavior and activity. 

In my negotiation coaching experience-and it's pretty broad, ranging over many different fields of business-I have seen that the failure to set manageable goals is as common a mistake as any other. People get confused because they don't have a step-by-step plan. They casually talk about goals and results, or objectives, but they don't really know how to distinguish between them. 

For one thing, they don't have a mission and purpose to guide them. They thereby put themselves on an emotional roller coaster, and this is a fatal error, as we shall see time and again in these pages. Disappointment, excitement, despair, hope-they experience the whole range of emotions, and all because they're reacting to events over which they don't have control and ignoring those over which they do have control.

Take just a minute to think back on some of your most critical negotiations, either in your business or private life. Did they really end, or did they keep going? If your goal had been to sign the deal, you were upset, and then you were in trouble, because you didn't know what to do next. But if your goal all along had been behavior and activity over which you had control, you had no problem at all. The first negotiation was nwo followed by a second negotiation. 

It's not hard to see that when you believe in the power of these kinds of statements, they have a tendency to become self-fulfilling prophecies. When doubt is directed toward one's potential to learn and perform or toward one's very self, it can be quite detrimental. Self-doubt is like a shadow that creates an uncomfortable feeling of separation within ourselves and, if believed in, can affect every action that comes from that feeling. 

A second step is to acknowledge that doubt hasn't totally destroyed this original faith. If you begin to dbout that your legs will move correctly to carry you downstairs, hesitancy may ruin the natural continuity of the action. To correct this, you might start giving yourself a set of instructions to correct your way of moving. If you allow doubt to build, it will eat away at your inherent faith, and the natural fluidity of your movements will deteriorate. Soon your movement downstairs will look as mechanical and self-conscious as many of the golf swings you see on the practice range. 

You do have to spend time and energy on nonpayside activities in order to get to payside, but, obviously, you want to keep the nonpayside to the minimum. A downfall of some glad-handing negotiators is to wine and dine potential customers, stop by their offices to shoot the breeze, play golf, send gifts and so on-all nonpayside activities-while never making the move to get down to serious negotiating. 

The single most important fuel that you have, the most important behavioral goal and habit you can develop, is your ability to ask questions. But the unwillingness or inability to ask good questions is a serious weakness in the field. If you master the art of questioning, your work as a negotiator will benefit enormously. 

Very few of us are trained to ask them, and even those whose professional work depends on this skill-I'm thinking of doctors and lawyers now-often don't do a very good job at it. Doctors forfeit one of their key diagnostic tools-asking good questions. The negotiator must try to see and understand her adversary's world. In any negotiation, where do we want to spend as much time as possible? In the adversary's world. Your mission nad purpose is set in your adversary's world. You want to inhabit the adversary's world, because that is the world about which you need information, and that is the perspective from which the adversary makes decisions. He doesn't make decisions from your perspective, does he? He makes them from his own perspective. How do you find out about this perspective? How do you inhabit his world? By asking questions.

As I've already discussed, our decisions are, initially, 100 percent emotional. After we've made our emotion-based decision, we need time to get the clear picture, the clear vision with which to rationally judge that decision. The adversary's answers to our questions build the vision that he needs to make decisions. 


It's some vision in our mind's eye that leads us to buy this house, to plant this flower, to negotiate this deal. All of us make decisions based on the vision we have of the issue at hand. No vision, no decision. It's vital that you understand this point. 

As a negotiator, questions are the fuels we use to lead the adversary to a vision that will serve as a catalyst for a decision. As much as possible, we want the negotiation to stay in our adversary's world. 

Questions do serve the further purpose of helping us control our own neediness and to be unokay, but the vital purpose of questions is to allow us to move around in the adversary's world and see what they see and then lead them to a clear vision and decision as well. 

Asking questions is a science and an art. The science is how you intellectually construct a question. The art is found in how you ask it: your tone of voice, your creative choice of words, your behavior and remarks before asking your question. So now we're going to get pretty technical, and we have to, because technique is everything here.

With only one worthwhile answer out of the three, it follows that verb-led questions are often a waste of time. Therefore there are only two reasons to ask such questions: if you already know the answer, or if you're near the every end of the negotiation and you have to really bore in. 

The answer to the verb-led question usually does not give you worthwhile information. That's one problem. Another problem is that such a question can often seem to the adversary as if you're driving for a yes. 

A third step is to make an important distinction between the voice of doubt and you. When doubt knocks at your door, no one syas you have to open it, much less invite it in for tea. However, if like me, you were raised in an environment of doubt and always having to prove yourself, it's possible to become so emmeshed in it that you can't tell the difference between yourself and the doubt. If you invite it in, you may listen, but you don't have to believe everything it says. 

Most golfers are aware that there is a conversation going on in their heads on and off the golf course. The value I find in recognizing this internal dialogue is that it allows me to separate myself from the undermining voice of self-doubt. What I call Self 1 is the one criticizing my swing on the court or the course; he is also the one making me try shots beyond my capability and then calling me stupid when I fail; more than anything he is the one trying to make sure I hit the ball right according to his most recent set of concepts about what is right. Self 2 is the one who has to hit the golf ball, the one being addressed by this criticizing, doubting, overcontrolling voice of Self 1. 

World class performers went further and included in their comments an unusual description, a description of an experiential dream-a feeling really-that characterized what was going on inside of them when they were performing at their best and enjoying it the most. A two-time NCAA player of the year in basketball said, "Look, it's not about winning the gold medal. That's our goal, sure. But that's not why my dream, that's not why I play. My dream is to play to win at the highest level for as long as I can." An Olympic gold medalist in swimming said his dream was easy speed, the harmony he felt in the water when he tried about 85 percent but got 100 percent of his speed. These sample definitions are experiential in that they describe feelings that people have when they are performing at their best, rather than what they are doing or what they are accomplishing.

Experiential dreams or internal dreams have to do with how one wants to feel. Most of us in life are systematically trained to ignore how we feel at the expense of what we are doing. What Newburg's subjects reported though is that what's going on inside not only is very important, but it can also significantly influence results. 

It wasn't enough to get good numbers, but one also had to develop relationships along the way. The dichotomy of task and process also emerged in Lawrence and Lorsch's groundbreaking study of organizational design when they noted that differentiation by task and integration across organizational boundaries was complementary and a necessary force in effective organizational designs. 

So, while the recognition of the need for balance between task and process is not new, Newburg's subjects clarified this distinction more sharply than many managers do: there are two kinds of dreams. One kind of dream is about achievement, and the other is about experience and feeling. 

In part this relates to our earlier discussion of emotional intelligence and the low capacity many have for recognizing their own emotions and emotional experience. Most people are not skilled at this. The internal dream's basic question is, how do you want to feel today? Most people never think about this and would probably find it, at first blush, irrelevant. It turns out that how you feel can have a big impact on your performance.
