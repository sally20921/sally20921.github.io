Hence the division between the romantics and the realists. Hidden behind this question looms a secret longing for the vital, the surge of erotic energy that marks our aliveness. Whatever safety and security people have persuaded themselves to settle for, they still very much want this force in their lives. Can we both love and desire in the same relationship over time? 

In fact, security and passion are two separate, fundamental human needs that springs from different motives and tend to pull us in different directions. We're walking contradictions, seeking safety and predictability on one hand and thriving on diversity on the other. 

This never ending dance between change and stability is like the anchor and the waves. Desire is fueled by the unknown, and for that reason it's inherently anxiety-producing. Eroticism resides in the ambiguous space between anxiety and fascination. 

Sexual excitement requires the capacity not to worry, and the pursuit of pleasure demands a degree of selfishness. The very caring he experiences makes it harder for him to focus on his own needs, to feel spontaneous, sexually alive, and carefree. Being close doesn't mean never fighting. 

But when we reduce sex to a function, we also invoke the idea of dysfunction. We are no longer talking about the art of sex; rather, we are talking about the mechanics of sex.

You can't choose between inhaling and exhaling; you have to do both. It's the same thing with intimacy and passion. I explain to Ben that the tension between security and adventure is a paradox to manage, not a problem to solve. Love and desire are two rhythmic yet clashing forces that are always in a state of flux and always looking for the balance point. 

When we confuse assertion with aggression, neutralize otherness, adjust our longings, and reason away our hostility, we assemble a calmness that is reassuring but not very exciting. The degradation of romance, the waning of desire, is due not to the contamination of love by aggression, but to the inability to sustain the necessary tension between them.
