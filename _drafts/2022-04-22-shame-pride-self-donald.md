<h2> The Compass of Shame </h2>

<h3> Range of Reactions </h3>

The happiest use of the generative ssytem involves the mutualization of arousal, excitement, and contentment in sexual activity; yet sex can be used as a weapon over a range from mild hostility to outright rape. The habit of cruelty to a dependent other is known as sadism. This form of attack is designed both to maintain connection with a chosen partner and to demonstrate the degree to which the perpetrator remains ascent over the victim.  

The study of the attack other mode is an exercise through which we come to appreciate the extraordinary range of human creativity. When the purpose of attack is to induce in the other the affects of shame, dissmell, and disgust, the methods can be marvelously subtle or terribly broad. They can gratify the needs of the attacker by their delicacy or by their intensity. 

The factors that govern both style and intensity of attack are related to highly personal scripts operating far from the conscious mind of the subject. To live in the world and to interact with others always brings risk of shame, from the momentary twinge of embarrassment at the most minor of slips to the mortification that accompanies massive public failure.

There are lots of reasons for someone to buy a new car, few of them automotive. New cars make us feel good about ourselves to the degree that they allow us to move up on the shame/pride axis. So the customer's request for special treatment was at least partially a demand for recognition of his recently elevated, fragile sense of self. 

Although the dispute remains one of power and dominance, he has been able to reduce the gap between himself and the customer. Both experienced the interchange as some combination of victory and defeat. If an attitude of withdrawal makes one appear somewhat depressed; if attack self tends to support deferrence and masochism; and if avoidance tends to favor narcissism; then attack other halts any tendency to look within the self and thus fosters systems of externalization, blame, and paranoia. 

Empathy allows us to experience ourselves as having power with others. But to the extent that our parents do not seem to hear, see, appreciate, or understand us, we grow up looking for ways to have power over others. 

Today we describe the unempathic parent somewhat more precisely as one who is not able to enter into affective resonance with a child. The lack of empathic connectedness and the consequent need for power can always be traced to failures in the communication of affect.

It is only a person with a characteristic stance of attack self who can form a stable link with one whose approach to life favors the scripts of attacking other. And it is obvious that one who lives within the code of attack other would be lonely indeed were it not for the ubiquity of people who agree to accept somewhat reduced status in order to prevent insecurity or abandonment.
