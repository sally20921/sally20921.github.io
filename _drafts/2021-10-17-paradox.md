Once I realized that my should and shouldn't instructions were part of what was getting in the way, I began to explore ways of helping student learn without them. I would hasten to say that I wasn't asking him to make any change, but just to observe what was happening. 

What amazed me was that in this nonjudgemental mode of observation of the ball, many of the technical elements of his swings would change spontaneously. The body was allowed its natural response to the perception of the ball, which was to step into it and hit it. This felt better and naturally produced better results. 

As coach, my first responsibility was to maintain a nonjudgemental focus, provide appropriate opportunity for natural learning, and stay out of the way. Paradoxicall,y it is conscious acceptance of oneself and one's actions as they are that frees up both the incentive and the capacity for spontaneous change. 

Our hardwiring, our language, and the evolving way we make sense of the world all seem to conspire against our best efforts to see the world with a both/and mindset. From an evoluationary perspective, the brain is masterful at either/or thinking, and it doesn't like nebulousness of both/and. From the earliest times, the brain has had to quickly determine if something was safe or dangerous. Seeing things in opposition is hardwired into our brains, we would have to work harder to hold a both/and mentality. 

Additionally, our languages do not adequately reflect the world's need for a both/and mentality. We do not have language to express the combination or harmonization of the two seemingly opposite states that must coexist over time for success to occur. 

The two poles in any interdependent pair are constantly pulling in seemingly opposite directions, creating an ongoing tension. 

Here is a puzzling fact: the best-performing firms often have more in common with humiliated bankrupts than with companies that have managed merely to survive. In fact, the very traits we have come to identify as determinants of high achievement are also the ingredient of total collapse. So it turns out that, behaviorally at least, the opposite of success is not failure, but mediocrity.
