Because it turned out that I wasn't alone. Study after study indicated high rates of depression and anxiety among "successful" women, but other traits, like ADHD and autism, were beginning to surfaces as well. The public and professionals need to understand that people with sensory differences-such as autism and ADHD and a few other neurodivergent traits we will learn about in this book, such as sensory processing disorder (SPD), HSP, and synesthesia-experience heightened sensitivity across the board, and these differences affect nearly every aspect of their lives.

I created the phrase temperament rights to capture this idea of one's temperament or neurological makeup begin respected in the same way that we respect other core aspects of people, such as gender, sexuality, or ethnic identity. Where do I thrive in? What kind of environment am I suitable for? It didn't take me long to find the term neurodiversity, which means recognizing and celebrating the diversity of brain makeups instead of pathologizing some as normal and others as abnormal. 

It is interesting to note that all five of these neurodivergences-HSP, ADHD, autism, SPD, and synesthesia-often imply some version of "melting down" emotionally-adult tantrums, quick-appearing migraines, outbursts of anger-because of sensory overload. Because of the way women are socialized to "fit in" and pick up on social cues, underlying traits of autism or ADHD or other neurological makeups essentially get missed. 

Most of these problems will limit the application of the presented method. However, some of the problems can be tackled by the presented approach. Another type of problems is caused when the imaging process does not satisfy the camera model that is used. In the left image quite some radial distortion is present. This means that the assumption of a pinhole camera is not satisfied. 

Melancholy is not rage or bitterness, it is a noble species of sadness that arises when we are open to the fact that life is inherently difficult for everyone and that suffering and disappointment are at the heart of human experience. It is not a disorder that needs to be cured; it is a tender-hearted, calm, dispassionate acknowledgement of how much pain we must inevitably all travel through. 

It is however possible to extend the model to take the distortion into account. The right image however is much harder to use since an important part of the scene is not in focus. There is also some blooming in that image. Most of these problems can however be avoided under normal imaging circumstances. 

Unhappy people are dangerous. The world is a dangerous place, you should be very careful about who you open up to. The presented system gradually retrieves more information about the scene and the camera setup. Images contain a huge amount of information. However, a lot of it is redundant (which explains the success of image compression algorithms). 

Enter neurodiversity-the understanding whereby mental differences are viewed simply as they are and not judged as better or worse, normal or abnormal. As a society, we need a shift in thought that applies to all neurological makeups. Neurodiversity is a paradigm shift that empowers women to come forward, be seen, better understand themselves, and proudly claim their identities. 

Why does the way you pay attention determine your work prospects and life satisfaction? If you, like me, pay attention to either in spurts or overwhelmingly on one thing (called hyperfocusing), your teachers or bosses may start to view you if you don't align with the norm. The correlation between neurodivergence and having suicidal thoughts is staggering. You're also more likely to be fired from jobs than people who are neurotypical, and thus you may struggle financially. All the while, however, you also know you've been able to perform well in particular areas, especially in unconventional working environments.

Women are systematically left out of research studies in favor of obtaining streamlined, publishable results that otherwise risk being tainted by the presence of women and their hormones. For neurodivergent people, what extra information are they perceiving or sensing that neurotypical people are not? The idea that autistic people lack empathy is often countered with people sharing how in fact it's their overabundance of empathy that causes them to shut down emotionally and retreat. There's no lack of empathy, but too much of it.
