<h2> Python Refresher </h2>

<h3> Dictionaries </h3>

The dictionary is a useful data structure for storing `(key,value)` pairs. 

```bash
calories = {'apple': 52, 'banana': 89, 'choco': 546}
```

You can read and write elements by specifying the key within brackets: 

```bash
print(calories['apple'] < calories['choco'])
# True 

calories['cappu'] = 74

print(calories['banana'] < calories['cappu'])
# False
```

Use the `keys()` and `values()` functions to access all keys and values of the dictionary. 

```bash
print('apple' in calories.keys())
# True
print(52 in calories.values())
# True
```
Access the `(key,value)` pairs of a dictionary with the `items()` method. 

```bash
for k, v in calories.items():
 print(k) if v > 500 else None
# 'choco'
```

This way, it's easy to iterate over all keys and all values in a dictionary without accessing them individually. 

<h3> Membership </h3>

Use the keyword `in` to check whether the set, list, or dictionary contains an element.

```bash
print(42 in [2,39,42])
# True
print("21" in {"2","39","42"})
# False
print("list" in {"list": [1,2,3], "set":{1,2,3}})
# True 
```
You use the keyword `in` to test membership of the integer value `42` in a list of integer values or to test membership of a string value "21" in a set of strings. We say `x` is a member of `y` if element `x` appears in the collection `y`. 

Checking set membership is faster than checking list membership: to check whether element `x` appears in list `y`, you need to traverse the whole list until you find `x` or have checked all elements. However, sets are implemented much like dictionaries: to check whether element `x` appears in set `y`, Python internally performs one operation `y[hash(x)]` and checks whether the return value is not `None`. 

<h3> List and Set Comprehension </h3>

List comprehension is a popular Python feature that helps you quickly create and modify lists. The simple formula is `[expression + context]`. 

Expression tells Python what to do with each element in the list. Context tells Python which list elements to select. The context consists of arbitrary number of `for` and `if` statements. 

For example, in the list comprehension statement `[x for x in range(3)]`, the first part `x` is the (identity) expression, and the second part `for x in range(3)` is the context. The statement creates the list `[0.1.2]`. The `range()` function returns a range of subsequent integer values 0,1, and 2-when used with one argument as in the example. Another code example for list comprehension is the following:

```bash
# (name, $-income)
customers = [("John", 24), ("Alice", 12), ("Ann", 11), ("Zach", 44)]
# your high-value customers earning >$1M
whales = [x for x,y in customers if y>10]
print(whales)
#['Ann']
```
Set comprehension is like list comprehension, but creates a set rather than a list.
