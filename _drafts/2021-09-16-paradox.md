We can view anything a person is currently doing as an activity, even if he's just lying on a couch bored out of his brains. This is useful because it lets us gauge how much of his total attention the person is currently employing, as well as how much pleasure he is currently experiencing. In that case, anxiety plays the role of an overseer: administering a sharp jolt of painful effect whenever the person considers quitting and switching to another task. Thus, anxiety doesn't just make the person finally begin his assignment, but also prevents him from quitting in the middle of doing it. 

Instead, every bit of evidence suggests that these people's ability to constantly overcome the pleasure unconscious by sheer force of will is merely an illusion. They most likely differ, primarily, not in their ability to behave contrary to motivation, but in the types of motivation they experience and the magnitude of the affect they feel in response to certain situations. 

One serious problem is that although the emotions of guilt and shame do serve as demotivators against committing the actions a person wants not to, they all too often aren't potent enough to prevent him from committing them. We've all certainly heard of guilty pleasures. It fails to have any physical effect on a person's negative actions, but is felt as a residual effect of committing them-which only serves to reduce the person's confidence and self-esteem.
