But ask an adult what you should do to ease the sharp pain of rejection, the devastating ache of loneliness, or the bitter disappointment of failure and the person would know little about how to treat these common psychological injuries. Ask what you should do to recover from low self-esteem or loss and trauma and adults would be equally challenged. Ask how you might deal with intrusive ruminations or nagging guilt and you are likely to be met with sheepish looks, feet shuffling, and a pointed effort to change the subject.

But while discussing our feelings might offer relief in some situations, it can actually be damaging in others. The reason we take little to no purposeful action to treat the psychological wounds we sustain in daily life is because we lack the tools with which to manage such experiences. We have no such medicine cabinet for the minor psychological injuries we sustain in daily life. And sustain them we do, just as frequently as we do physical ones. 

Treating such injuries not only accelerates their healing but also helps prevent complications from developing and mitigates the severity of any that do arise. As a result, we often neglect our psychological wounds until they become severe enough to impair our functioning. But offering immediate relief and doing deep psychological work are not mutually exclusive. I believe everyone should have access to emotional first aid treatment, just as they should any other treatments for dressing emotional wounds. 

Of all the emotional wounds we suffer in life, rejection is perhaps the most common. Rejections are the psychological cuts and scrapes that tear our emotional skin and penetrate our flesh. We drastically underestimate the pain rejections elicit and the psychological wounds they create. 

Many of the rejections we experience are comparatively mild and our injuries heal with time. But when left untreated, even the wounds created by mild rejections can become infected and cause psychological complications that seriously impact our mental well-being. When the rejections we experience are substantial, the urgency of treating our wounds with emotional first aid is far greater. In order to administer emotional first aid and successfully treat the four wounds rejection causes, we need a clear understanding of each of them and a full appreciation of how our emotions, thought processes, and behaviors are damaged when we experience rejections.

But when psychologists investigated this very situation, they found something quite remarkable. We do care, far more than we realize. Dozens of studies have demonstrated that people consistently report feeling significant emotional pain as a result of being excluded from the ball-tossing game. 

If such a trivial experience can elicit sharp emotional pain (as well as drops in mood and self-esteem) we can begin to appreciate how painful truly meaningful rejections are. That is why getting dumped by someone we're dating, getting fired from our job, or discovering that our friends have been meeting up without us can have such a huge impact on our emotional well-being.

True, few of us have actually been stabbed in the chest, but when psychologists asked people to compare the pain of rejection to physical pains they had experienced, they rated their emotional pain as equal in severity to that associated with natural childbirth and cancer treatments! But why do rejections hurt so much more than other emotional wounds?

The answer lies in our evolutionary past. Humans are social animals; being rejected from our tribe or social group in our precivilized past would have meant losing access to food, protection, and mating partners, making it extremely difficult to survive. Our brains developed an early-warning system to alert us when we were at risk for voted off the island by triggering sharp pain whenever we experience even a hint of social rejection.

In fact, brain scans show that the very same brain regions get activated when we experience rejection as when we experience physical pain. Remarkably, the two systems are so tightly linked that when scientists gave people acetaminophen before putting them through the dastardly ball-tossing rejection experiment, they reported significantly less emotional pain than people who were not given a pain reliever. 

Sadly, other negative emotions like embarrasment do not share these characteristics, rendering Tylenol ineffective when we get the dat wrong for our office Halloween party and show up work dressed like Marge Simpson.

While Martha had been sympathetic initially, she was becoming increasingly frustrated about Angelo's inability to recover from the emotional blow and start looking for a new job. It quickly became apparent that Angelo was as frustrated with himself as Martha was. He tried to motivate himself and talk himself into making efforts, but he simply felt too consumed by emotional pain. He tried reasoning with himself to let go of the hurt and get over its, but nothing worked.

Many of us find it difficult to talk ourselves out of the hurt we feel when we experience rejection. One of the reasons rejection is often so devastating is that our reason, logic, and common sense are usually ineffective when it comes to mitigating the pain we feel. For example, finding out the rejection wasn't even real did little to ease the pain they felt. Surely rejection would hurt less if we despised the people who rejected us. But nope, it still hurt just as much. But subjects felt just as much rejection pain when they were not passed a cyberbomb as they were when they were not passed a cyberball.

Rejections impact our ability to use sound logic and think clearly in other ways as well. For example, merely being asked to recall episodes of acute rejection was sufficient for people to score substantially lower on subsequent IQ tests, tests of short-term memory, and measures of reasoning ability and decision making.

Romantic rejections are especially potent when it comes to scrambling our brains and tampering with our good judgement, even when they occur extremely early in a relationship or, indeed, before a relationship even exists. Rejections often trigger anger and aggressive impulses that causes us to feel a powerful urge to lash out, especially at those who rejected us, but in a pinch, innocent bystanders will do. Keeping such dangers in mind is equally important when we're the ones doing the rejecting. Even if the person we plan to reject is a model of kindheartedness, our Hummel figurine collection might still be in grave danger.

We should consider that even the most inconsequential rejections stir up highly aggressive tendencies in the best of us. Unfortunately, our tendency to respond to rejection with anger has far darker and more serious manifestations as well. Severe and repeated experience of rejection can elicit the kind of aggression that goes far beyond the realm of white noise or hot sauce. When psychological wounds of this nature are left untreated they quickly become infected and threaten serious damage to a person's mental health. 

Experiencing profound or repeated rejection is extremely harmful to our self-esteem. In fact, the mere act of recalling a previous rejection is sufficient to cause a temporary drop in feelings of self-worth. We often compound our rejection experiences by becoming extremely self-critical-essentially kicking ourselves when we're already down. Responding this way is common but it can easily cause the psychological cuts and scrapes of the original rejection to become infected and consequently to have a truly debilitating effect on our mental health. 

Angelo lost his job at the shipping company because his entire department got eliminated in a cost-cutting measure, yet he perceived the rejection as highly personal. Personalizing the rejection made Angelo feel as though he was unwanted by his friends and abandoned by his long-time colleagues. 

We all have a tendency to take rejections too personally and to draw conclusions about our shortcomings when there is little evidence that such assumptions are warranted. Think back to when you were rejected by someone romantically. Did you find yourself listing everything that might be wrong with you? Did you fault yourself for not being attractive enough or sophisticated enough or smart enough or all of the above? Personal rejections are rarely as personal as we experience them to be, and even when they are, they rarely involve such a sweeping indictment of our flaws. 

In addition to unnecessarily personalizing rejection, we also tend to overgeneralize it even when we have no grounds to do so or to engage in needless self-criticism by assuming we could have prevented the rejection had we done something differently. Self-criticism is especially problematic following romantic rejections, as many of us spend hours analyzing everything we said or did in a desperate search for our elusive critical wrong move. 

In reality, critical wrong moves are exceedingly rare. The most frequent reasons we get turned down as romantic prospects are because we don't match the person's or company's specific needs at that time, or because we don't fit the narrow definition of who they're looking for-not because of any critical missteps we might have made nor because we have any fatal character flaws. 

These errors in thinking serve little useful purpose and they only deepen the pain we already feel by adding unnecessary and highly inaccurate self-recriminations that further damage our already battered self-esteem. Rejections hurt enough-we certainly don't need to add salt to our own wounds or kick ourselves once we're already down.

Think back a littel bit more about mission and purpose. Remember the features and benefits to your adversary that we want to be part of our misson and purpose? Such features and benefits can also be a part of your questions. The words that describe a feature or a benefit can be placed in the question to help the adversary see a problem. 

Notice the vital difference between "How can you stay competitive without this technology?" and "Can you stay competitive without this technology?" Keep your questions short. Anytime a question has more than, say, nine or ten words you risk complication. You may think that a lengthy compound question sounds impressive, but you're not in the business of sounding impressive, remember. Such a question serves only to kill vision and confuse your adversary. 

Remember when I said that if our own mission and purpose is too cloudy, we make it difficult for our adversary to make a decision? The same thing goes with questions. Another key is to ask one question at a time. Simple question by simple question, answer by answer, you will help your adversary build his own picture of the issue. But often we don't do this. A negotiation is a very emotional arena, of course, and we get impatient and load one question on top of another, barely pausing to take a breath, much less letting the adversary answer. Instead, you must take each question slow and easy and listen to each answer, because the answer is the clue for framing the next question.

Asking good questions is the highest octane fuel we have. They are a key behavioral goal. Of the give other behavioral goals that I call the fuels of the system, four work in direct support of our questions. They help us control what we say. They help us use our words to our advantage. I call these four fuels nurturing, reversing, connecting. The fifth fuel, unrelated to questions, is the strip line. 

Nurturing should be part of your body language. When you're seated, refrain from a sudden forward movement. Lean back. Relax your neck, face and hands. If you're standing, lean against the wall, lower your posture. The truly comfortable, trained negotiator takes it easy. When in doubt, slow your cadence of speech, lower your voice. Laughter often is the best medicine, especially laughter directed at ourselves. Laughter is a way to nurture everyone in the room-including ourselves. 

Even more important than what you say for nurturing purposes is how you say it. Delivery is everything. We all know this, but too often we forget it. In any negotiation, the reverse assures that you're dealing with an important question for you, thereby allowing you to gather more insight and information. 

Questions and reversing help us get into the world of the adversary. They are the way we create vision. Without reversing and asking questions, we'll get nowhere. 

As I've said in several contexts, we have a tendency to want to save our adversary, to be liked. Never answer an unasked question; don't interpret a statement as a question; and never reply to random statements.

Profound, silent concern on your part can also serve as a connector. People don't like silence. The task of the good negotiator is to keep the pendulum as close as possible to a calm, stationary mode. 

These big swings are a vicious cycle, so to speak, and they're almost impossible to control. You mean you don't want the adversary to get all excited about this deal? No, we don't, because the excitement won't last; those inevitable second thoughts will come along sooner or later. 

I've already pointed out some of the dangers of neediness. Your ability to blank slate is directly related to your ability to rid yourself of expectations and assumptions, two very bad words in my system of negotiation. By nature, we humans are chock-full of expectations and assumptions. As a negotiator, you must learn to recognize them and set them aside. 

Now what about assumptions, the other chief obstacle to effective blank slating? They're just as dangerous as positive and negative expectations, and just as common, because most of us come to believe that we're pretty good at reading other people, at understanding what they're really feeling and thinking. Negotiators, in particular, tend to pride themselves on their people skills. 

By its very nature, if we stop to think about the process, note taking removes us from our world and keeps us in our adversary's world.
