<h2> Abstract </h2>

This article presents a concept underlying excellence called resonance, which was developed based on research interviews and consulting practice with high-level performers from all walks of life. Findings suggest that many high-caliber performers follow a typical process as they become experts in their chosen field. 

They have a dream, which represents how they want to feel in their daily pursuits. They also engage in extensive preparation, which includes activities that enable them to live their dream. All of the participants faced obstacles, but they developed strategies to revisit their dream before they actually engaged in more preparation. 

This cyclical process that guided their performance and life has been termed resonance, which occurs when there is a seamless fit between their internal self and their external environment. It is captured in the resonance performance model (RPM), a heuristic model devised to guide the practice of consultants. The article also includes a discussion of the RPM in relation to other performance-related concepts such as flow, presents some recent and future research with resonance, and considers practical application for consultants who may be interested in using the RPM. 

<h2> Introduction </h2>

The best performances are always when a performer can frree himself from the impossible conception of providing a perfect performance and instead unabashedly knocks down these walls and fearlessly expresses himself. 

What does it mean to perform? Is there a process of engagement that underlies outstanding performance, whether it be working, strength training, shooting a basketball, or performing emergency triple bypass surgery? How do people become excellent performers? If people's performances are engaging, will they perform better? What role does personal meaning play in the process of resonance?

These are the questions in which we are interested in and we believe to be relevant to a special issue on performance excellence. We will explore some possible answers in this article by presenting a concept called resonance. First, we will explain resonance, its origins, and its relation to engagement and performance excellence. Second, we will discuss possible links between resonance and other performance-relevant concepts, such as emotions, flow, and intrinsic motivation. Finally, we will discuss how resonance has been and can be used to help individuals from a variety of life contexts engage in high-quality performance and live a meaningful life in the process. 

<h2> The Resonance Performance Model </h2>

The RPM depicts high-level performance as a circular, dynamic, and ongoing process. The RPM has four main components: dream, preparation, obstacles, and revisit the dream. For ease of presentation, each component
