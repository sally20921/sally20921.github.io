We often reduce the problem that we really have trying to solve the problem. However, the problem often turns out to be more complicated then what we have assumed. 

How difficult it is for human to observe without judging. Perhaps we were born to make judge, make decisions, and see the world has black or white. 

I think it is important to have faith because at the end you gotta make a decision anyway. To choose one is to accept not only the benefits but also the consequences as well. Life isn't binary but often we have to see things as binary and make a decision. That's the hard part. It is prone to mistakes. But that does not mean that we should get rid of the structure. 

I am thinking the more complicated the problem gets, the simpler you have to think. That is an irony. Maybe a paradox. Is it possible for a human being to completely embrace both sides of polarity? Is that really beneficial? 

The world is full of paradox. I get it. But what to do about it? That is the most hardest question that I don't think anyone has yet come up with a good answer. I am sensing towards accepting and observing the world as it is without judgement.

Should we try to see the world without judgement? Is that really beneficial? But what are the circumstances when you have to see the world without judgement? What is the context?

There are times when you need to engage, be in the flow, be curious and playful, be authentic and there are times you need to put your guard up, and be careful with your surroundings. I think I've learned that being open to other human beings is not such a good idea. But we cannot be closed to everything, or we won't be able to feel anything. In order to feel joy, you need to engage. Is engaging in what you like to do always a great choice? No, because there's a fine-line between engagement and addiction. What divides this two? 

Life is messy. Very messy. It is natural to get confused. We should have some boundaries, but be aware that life does not always work that way. 

Can success be one of the most awful thing that can happen to a person who enjoys the activity for its own sake? It's terrible, almost a curse. Yet being a human being, we cannot escape the paradox of success. 

When are the times when we have to ignore our weakness and build on our strengths? When are the times when we have to work on our weaknesses?

There are times when reacting emotionally actually helps. As a human you should try to feel rather than think for your own sake. That is healthy. But yet there are times when is very detrimental to do so. Some say you should follow your heart. Others say human intuition is full of deception. When do I follow my heart? When do I not?

Always think about the inverse. Why is that? Why does that help? Well, my answer is sometimes it doesn't. It could be a waste of energy contemplating every little inverse of tiny decisions we have to make for our lives. And yet, it helps. It helps because it lets you see the paradox. Then another question is, why is the world so paradoxical? Why isn't it logical? Because the tension itself, the struggle itself is what makes us move forward. Without tension, without struggle, there is no evolution.   

We see what we want to see, and hear what we want to hear. Why do creative people succeed? Because they take extraordinary measures to make their reality real. People who succeed are great deceivers who have succeeded to fool other people with their reality. 

A strong willed person is a creative person who is good at lying to themselves. 


This started as playful and curious, but ended up being pretty damn serious. What an irony!

Do not expect something will lead you to glory, because it will not! Making one choice always comes with ugly price. Life is like constantly paying the price you wouldn't have signed up for if you knew.   

Is there a dark side to being grateful?

If you follow with the flow, you're life will be mediocre. You have to have the courage to accept that if you want to stay in the society's boundaries. If you follow your heart, you are going to disappoint a lot of people. You are gonna have to be okay with that. At some point, your parents, professor, boyfriend are gonna be very disappointed with you. It depends on whether I have the courage to stand alone and believe in myself when no one else does. I do not think I am ready to disappoint people around me. This is terrifying. But it is also what I really need to learn. To be on my side, to choose me, rather than pleasing the other person.

I do not know why, but disappointing someone, especially someone I care for, terrifies me. I don't know if I have the courage to go on when I become labelled as a disappointment. 

Why do human beings have this desire to be liked? To come off as a good person? To feel like a good person?

So maybe there are two things I need to work on: accepting without judgement and choosing me instead of other people. And maybe accept mistakes and failures as a natural consequence of any action or choice.

I am going to have to get used to the feeling of uncertainty. Uncertainty leaves you in a very vulnerable state, and in some way you are going to fail and make mistakes, and that is okay. 

There is no perfect solution. The truth is that you cannot have it all. What kind of price are you going to pay? You gotta let go of some of the things you want. Or you are gonna losethem all. I have to let go of the perfect picture in my head and accept the world as is. I am going to fail, and that is okay. I am going to disappoint people, and that is okay. Some things are not going to go as planned, and that is okay.

Here's another paradox. In order to be playful and curious (at something), you must be doubtful and logical (at other things). In order to trust yourself at something, you have to doubt yourself at other things. In order to trust the right people, you have to doubt other people. But the question is, is this the time to engage or avoid? 

People pleasing can be thought of this way. In order not to disappoint other people, you need to disappoint them. Life can be thought of this way. In order to look at things thoroughly, in a difficult way, you have to think of other things the easy way. In order to have what I want, I must let go of what I want. Sometimes you have to overlook stuff to really focus on what matters. You cannot analyze every part of your life and decisions. Or you will end up losing it all.

You have to make a decision about some things in order to not make a decision, that is in order to look things polarized in the really important stuff.
