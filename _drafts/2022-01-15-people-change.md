<h2> How People Change </h2>

Rats are realists and soon come to accept that the cheese is gone and move on to explore the other tunnels. Humans, on the other hand, will go down the third tunnel forever because they come to believe that that's where the cheese should be. Within a few generations, humans will develop rituals, philosophies, and religions focused on the third tunnel, invent gods to rule over it, and create demons to inhabit the other four. 

Our brains are organs of adaptation and survival, designed to do things as fast as possible with the least amount of information. So once they get things right, like never expressing negative emotions during childhood, brains may become shaped to never express negative emotions again. Such a person might also adopt pacifist philosophies, get into relationships with violent people, and feel like a success because he or she didn't express negative emotions. Brains excel in coming to unconscious conclusions and shaping our conscious expreience to reinforce the beliefs we already hold. 

Brains are inherently conservative and want to keep doing what's worked in the past: Don't take risks, do what your parents want you to do, fit in, and contribute to the common good. When our life isn't working and we are anxious, depressed, or engaging in self-destructive behaviors, we go to therapy seeking change. Often, we are unaware of what is causing our suffering and continue to employ the same unsuccessful strategies in our lives with continued negative results. 

As therapists, most of us have noticed that our smartest clients can be the most difficult to help change because they are often well rewarded for doing things their way. In contrast to our brains, our minds emerged much farther down the evolutionary path. We still don't understand the origins of the mind, but it probably had something to do with groups of brains coming together to form the superorganisms we call tribes. 

Such shifts in both the public and private perceptions of an emotion have been a central interest of mine for many decades. From early childhood I have asked three questions: What is emotion? Why does the human have so much of it? and What can be done about it? 

Any attempt to study shame and pride will be flawed and misleading unless these emotions are placed in the context of general theory of emotion. This is more true for shame than for any other emotion. As I will demonstrate in a later chapter, the reasons it has been hidden and ignored are both intrinsic to its biological nature and implicit in the general theories of emotion prevalent until recently. 

Many of us treat emotion merely as something that interferes with thinking. We demean arguments by calling them emotional, discredit people who seem emotionally involved in whatever bothers them, trust feelings less than cognition. Our culture even has code words that allow us to pretend we are talking about thinking rather than feeling. Rather than admit that our concern is emotional, we will say, "I have a problem that," or "Don't bother me with such ideas," or "That upsets me." Pretty much, we take for granted that emotion exists, for better or worse, and that we have to live with it. 

Of course I believe that there is a sexual drive and that it has a powerful influence on human development. But it is neither the basic motivating force for which Freud searched nor the source of emotion itself. As a matter of fact, the new work on emotion allows us to present entirely new theory for the nature of human sexuality, as well as the relation between sex and shame. 

From now on I will use the word affect to describe the strictly biological portion of emotion. When we have been affected by somehting we have experienced an emotion because of it; when disaffected we are indifferent and have little emotional involvement. Michael Franz Basch has suggested that we use the word feeling to indicate that the organism has become aware of an affect. Feeling implies the presence of higher order mechanisms or components that allow knowledge and understanding. People may be raised in a culture or an environment that denies the existence of certain feelings; even when an affect is triggered they may not feel it because the ability to perceive it has been extinguished. 


Each affect has been triggered time and time again over the life span of every individual, and on every occasion this has happened in the context of some situation, interaction or scene. 

On the contrary, there is no psychological problem or emotional malady that is impervious to change, providing a person has both motivation and understanding. Unbelievable as it may sound, most people cannot tolerate the kind of life they really desire. Most of us reject or manipulate our environments to keep from feeling an emotional experience that contradicts our early conception of reality. This is a major reason for our resistance to change. 
This defense of showing an "act of love" instead of real affection is not a minor form of dishonesty. It damages us and those people closest to us. Knowing the difference between real feelings and role-determined feelings is a very important step toward change, toward feeling as a whole. 

Most books on child-rearing do an untold amount of damage because they promote cover-ups; they teach parents to act the proper response rather than express their genuine feelings. Years of dishonest behavior cause serious damage because it confuses a child's sense of reality. 

Withholding and withdrawal can start very early in a relationship. To a large degree, these husbands and wives are telling the truth. Their mates have increasingly retreated from the loving way they once were. For some people, this backing away starts even before closeness has a chance to develop. 

To the extent that our parents are cutoff or emotionally deadened to their own feelings, they will deprive us of love and sensitivity. Contrary to their best wishes and dreams for us, their personal system of defenses will deeply restrict their ability to provide us with the emotional support necessary for our development and growth. 

He feels guilty because it is unthinkable, even immoral that he may not have the so-called "normal" feelings of love toward his child. The fact that parents are supposed to love their children creates a sense of pressure and obligation in most parents. It would be better for all concerned if parents could realize that it is humanly impossible to love their children all the time. 

The child is discouraged from crying when he is in pain because the crying indicates to the parent that he is somehow inadequate. Neither the parent nor the child wants to know that the parent is inadequate in his ability to love and to provide security. 

Each affect has been triggered time and time again over the life span of every individual, and on every occasion this has happened in the context of some situation, interaction, or scene. As an adult, for instance, I am not merely embarassed. I am embarassed in a situation that resembles one in which I was embarassed last month, or last year, or frequently in a way I cannot alter, or in a relationship that resembles the one in which I find myself today. Very quickly, as the growing child accumulates experience, affects become intertwined with memory. To the extent that an organism has an intact system for the storage and retrieval of information, it will be able to call upon this storehouse of memories of previous experiences of an affect. 

An emotion, suggests Basch, is the complex combination of an affect with these memories and with the affects they also trigger. Whereas affect is biology, emotion is biography. For me to understand your anger you must tell me something about the history of your affective experiences. When our storehouse of such memories is exhausted, the emotion wanes and our attention shifts to whatever next triggers an affect. What happens if some of these memoires bring to current attention an unsolved problem from the past or the emotions hovering around a relationship we never managed to resolve? 

What if the now-triggered combination of thoughts and feelings places us squarely in the middle of some part of our emotional life we had hoped to escape by the magic of ignoring? What if the sheer weight of current sadness compounded by sadness past is more than can be dissipated? Emotion then gives way to mood, a persistent state of emotion in which we can remain stuck for hours and days. 

There are times when a mood simply won't go away, when nothing we can do will disperse it. In times like these one tries everything, from the distraction or diversion offered by an entertainment or a vacation to a major reorganization of life like a shift in career. Often such a mood will precipitate a person into psychotherapy, for each therapeutic system offers its own method for the alteration of mood. 

One of the reasons affect feels different from the others is that is triggers a separate group of bodily reactions. I use the term site of action to describe the places in the body where an affect can become a feeling. Thus it appears that it is not only appraisals of relational devaluation, involving the perception that one is literally worthless to one's partner.
What is it exactly, that can so injure an individual and generate such psychological pain? Feeny argued that relational rule violations that threaten people's perceptions of themselves as worthwhile and lovable or that threaten their perceptions of their partners as responsive and trustworthy are the ones that cut the deepest and cause the most severe pain. To reiterate the point previously made, the intensity of this pain functions to let us know that we are uncared for and thus unsafe. 

The crucial question here, however, is why the kinds of appraisals describe above generate hurt, rather than anger, fear or sadness. Others speculate that hurt may be a discrete emotion in its own right, distinct from emotions such as anger, fear, sadness. Specifically, hurt-eliciting events were appraised as significantly more unexpected, effortful, and difficult to understand than anger or sadness-eliciting events. 
They were also associated with strong feelings of confusion and distress, and the most frequently reported action tendencies involved urges to cry and to leave the situation. Respondants also reported feeling weak, shaky, disoriented, as if they were in shock. In particular, the experience of hurt appeared to force respondents to think the unthinkable-that they were not loved as much as they wanted or needed. 

It was in the sadness accounts that respondents were most likely to report heart-related symptoms along with self-pitying thoughts and feelings of yearnings, loneliness, and emptiness. Overall, despite some inevitable overlap, laypeople can distinguish hurt from anger and sadness, and the most salient cognitive appraisals generating hurt involved high unexpectedness, effort and lack of understanding. 

These findings are in line with theoretical speculations that humans may rapidly register relationally threatening events at an affective or emotional level before much conscious cognitive processing has had a chance to occur. In this sense, the emotional state of hurt described by respondents in the current study resembles what other theorists have described as a relatively undifferentiated state of distress. For example, Rosman characterized distress as having a distinct phenomenology (thinking you do not know what to do to make things less upsetting) and action tendency (feeling like moving away from something). 

Distress is also strongly associated with crying, in both children and adults. However, distress may be elicited by the experience of any kind of aversive stimulus, including physical pain, hunger or thirst, whereas hurt requires us to have developed expectations about others and the extent to which they cared for us. 

Further, the results of a study examining laypeople's abilities to discriminate between hurt and a range of other emotional states found that hurt could be distinguished from upset and distress. Clearly, and as noted also by Feeney, hurt is predicated on attachment relationships and our perceptions of ourselves as lovable and of others as trustworthy. Perceiving that we may be worthless to someone we trust and love or that they do not value their relationship with us as much as we assumed is therefore shocking, threatening, and painful.

These authors have stressed the way in which traditional constraints and expectations have been stripped away to leave intimate relationships bereft of such external supports. They have identified the emergence of what they call 'the pure relationship', which has meant that intimate relationships have become increasingly fragile, as their external anchorages have fallen away. 

This contrasts with 'loving attachment', which needs to be worked at, otherwise it will die. This is made all the more acute as couples become long term they become aware of the need to accomodate their partner's differences and demands that the bouple begin to grapple with the complexities of life and its practical demands (such as work, having children, and so on) and this requires rather more than their love to keep them warm. 

As noted, those who feel that their relationship has dwindled into this state often want to end it because it lacks passionate fulfillment and emotional satisfaction. On the other hand, for a host of reasons, many people endure such an unsatisfactory state of affairs whilst building up resentment and anger toward their partner. In such relationships there is a loss of communication, an inability to reach out to the other either physically or emotionally, and a tendency to detach and drift apart. Very often there is 'polite sex' rather than 'intimate love making' and the couple may even 'consider their marriage to be good even if the lovemaking is routine and unfulfilled'.

Perhaps the voice evolved because the additional power it gave to the expression of affect increased in the organism's ability to survive. By far the most important site of action for affect display is the face. Nowhere else in the body can the anatomist demonstrate so many perfectly developed muscle groups packed together so well, each group served by its own specific nerve trunk. Many of the muscles of expression seem to have no function other than their relation to affect. 

The 'hostile' variations in the state of the world that would prevent control systems from achieving their goals are called disturbances. Control systems achieve their goals in spite of these disturbances by acting to counter the potential effects of the disturbances. So, both the thermostat and the person walking across the street are controlling, because both are achieving their goals by acting to counter disturbances that would otherwise keep the goals from being achieved. 

There is no single behavior, no particular pattern of arm and leg movements, that equates to 'crossing the street.' 'Crossing the street', like all other behavior, is an achievement that results from precisely varying actions to counter disturbances that would prevent the behavior from happening consistently. When we see people producing certain behaviors consistently we are seeing them controlling. Behaving is controlling. 

All behavior is happening in a world filled with disturbances that vary constantly and unpredictably. Indeed, we learned that being a successful controlling person is essential to our psychological health and ultimately our own survival. We feel best when we are in control of our lives. There is a built-in catch to being a controlling person because our efforts to be in control can also cause us to lose control. This happens when we try to control things that we can't (or shouldn't) control. 

And one of those things is other people's behavior. This is because other people are controlling people too, just like us, with their own ideas about what they should be doing (controlling). So our efforts to get a person to do what we want will be resisted if what we want is not what they themselves want, and we lose control.

The 'catch' to being a controlling person is that we can't stop doing what causes us to lose control because we can't stop controlling. We can't stop trying to get the world and the people in it to be the way we think they should be. Getting people (including ourselves) to behave as they should is as much a part of being a controlling person as gettting our checkbook balanced or our car started in the morning. 

So, paradoxically, our own controlling nature is, to some extent, the enemy itself. We can't help trying to be in control, but when we try to control some things, such as other people, we lose control of the very things we are trying to control. This is the paradox of controlling people in a slightly different form. People who control what they can't control, such as other people, seem to be in the impossible position of controlling and losing control at the same time. 

While it looks like people can't be in control and lose control at the same time, they can. The solution to these paradoxes hinges on understanding our own nature as controlling people. It means having the courage to control what we can control, the serenity to know what we can't, and the wisdom to know the difference.
