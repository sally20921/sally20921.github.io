    "title": "Homogeneous Coordinates and Projective Geometry",
    "body": "Introduction to Projective Geometry: Most of the time when working with 3D, we are thinking in terms of Euclidean geometry-that is, coordinates in three-dimensional space ($X$, $Y$ and $Z$). However, there are certain situations where it is useful to think in terms of projective geometry instead. Projective geometry has an extra dimension, called $W$, in addition to the $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ dimensions. This four-dimensional space is called projective space and coordinates in projective space are called homogenous coordinates. For the purposes of 3D software, the terms projective and homogeous are basically interchangeable with 4D. Not Quaternions: Quaternions look a lot like homogeneous coordinates. Both are 4D vectors, commonly depicted as $(X,Y,Z,W)$. However, quaternions and homogeneous coordinates are different concepts, with different uses. An Analogy in 2D: First, let’s look at how projective geometry works in 2D, before we move on to 3D.  Imagine a projector that is projecting a 2D image onto a screen. It’s easy to identify the $X$ and $Y$ dimensions of the projected image.  Now, if you step back from the 2D image and look at the projector and the screen, you can see the $W$ dimension, too. The $W$ dimension is the distance from the projector to the screen .  So what does the $W$ dimension do, exactly? Imagine what would happen to the 2D image if you increased or decreased $W$-that is, if you increased or decreased the distance between the projector and the screen. If you move the projector closer to the screen, the whole 2D image becomes smaller. If you move the projector away from the screen, the 2D image becomes larger. As you can see, the value of $W$ affects the size (a. k. a scale) of the image . Applying it to 3D: There is no such thing as a 3D projector (yet), so its’ harder to imagine projective geometry in 3D, but the $W$ value works exactly the same as it does in 2D. When $W$ increases, the coordinates expands (scales up). When $W$ decreases, the coordinates shrinks (scales down). The $W$ is basically a scaling transformation for the 3D coordinates . When $W = 1$: The usual advice for 3D programming beginners is to always set $W=1$ whenever converting a 3D coordinate to 4D coordinate. The reason for that is that when you scale a coordinate by a 1 it doesn’t shrink or grow, it just stays the same size. So, when $W=1$, it has no effect on the $X$, $Y$, or $Z$ values . For this reason, when it comes to 3D computer graphics, coordinates are said to be correct only when $W=1$. If you tried to render with $W=0$ your program would crash when it attempted to divide by zero. With $W&lt;0$ everything would flip unside-down and back-to-front. Mathematically speaking, there is no such thing as an incorrect homogeneous coordinate.  Using coordinates with $W=1$ is just a useful convention for the 3D computer grahics . The Math: Now, let’s look at some actual numbers, to see how the math works.  Let’s say that the projector is $3$ meters away from the screen, and there is a dot on the 2D image at the coordinate $(15, 21)$. This gives us the projective coordinate vector $(X,Y,W) = (15,21,3)$.  Now imagine that the projector was pushed closer to the screen so that the distance was $1$ meter. The closer the project gets to the screen, the smaller the image becomes. The projector has moved three times closer, so the image becomes three times smaller. If we take the original coordinate vector and divide all the values by three, we get the new vector where $W=1$:  $$(\frac{15}{3}, \frac{21}{3}, \frac{3}{3}) = (5,7,1)$$. The dot is now at coordinate $(5,7)$. This is how an incorrect homogeneous coordinate is converted to a correct coordinate: divide all the values by $W$. The process is exactly the same for 2D and 3D coordinates. Dividing all the values in a vector is done by a scalar multiplication with the reciprocal of the divisor. Here is a 4D example:  $$\frac{1}{5}(10, 20, 30, 5) = (\frac{10}{5}, \frac{20}{5}, \frac{30}{5}, \frac{5}{5}) = (2,4,6,1)$$ Uses of Homogeneous Coordinates in Computer Graphics: As mentioned earlier, in regard to 3D computer graphics, homogeneous coordinates are useful in certain situations. We will look at some of those situations here. Translation Matrices for 3D Coordinates:  A four-column matrix can only be multiplied with a four-element vector, which is why we often use homogeneous 4D vectors instead of 3D vectors. Rotation and scaling transformation matrices only require three columns. But, in order to do translation, the matrices need to have at least four columns . This is why transformations are often $4 \times 4$ matices. However, a matrix with four columns cannot be multiplied by a 3D vector, due to the rules of matrix multiplication. A four-column matrix can only be mulitplied with a four-element vector, which is why we often use homogeneous 4D vectors instead of 3D vectors. The 4th dimension $W$ is usually unchanged, when using homogeneous coordinates in matrix transformation. $W$ is set to $1$ when converting 3D coordinates into 4D, and is usually still $1$ after the transformation matrices are applied, at which point it can be converted back into a 3D coordinate by ignoring $W$. This is true for all translation, rotation, and scaling transformations, which by far are the most common types of transformations. The notable exception is projection matrices, which do affect the $W$ dimension. Perspective Transformation: In 3D, perspective is the phenomenon where an object appears smaller the further away it is from the camera. A far-away mountain can appear to be smaller than a cat, if the cat is close enough to the camera. Perspective is implemented in 3D computer graphics by using a transformation matrix that changes the $W$ element of each vertex. After the camera matrix is applied to each vertex, but before the projection matrix is applied, the $Z$ element of each vertex represents the distance away from the camera. Therefore, the larger $Z$ is, the more the vertex should be scaled down. The $W$ dimension affects the scale, so the projection matrix just changes the $W$ based on the $Z$ value. Here is an example of a perspective projection matrix being applied to a homogeneous coordinate:  $$ \begin{bmatrix} 1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \\ 0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp; \\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0 \\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} $$ Notice how the $W$ value is changed to $4$, which comes from the $Z$ value. After the perspective projection matrix is applied, each vertex undergoes perspective division. Perspective division is just a specific term for converting the homogeneous coordinate back to $W=1$, as explained earlier in the article. Continuing with the example above, the perspective division step would look like this:  $$\frac{1}{4}(2,3,4,4) = (0. 5,0. 75, 1,1)$$ After perspective division, the $W$ value is discarded, and we are left with a 3D coordinate that has been correctly scaled according to a 3D perspective projection. Positioning Directional Lights: One property of homogeneous coordinates is that they allow you to have points at infinity (infinite length vectors), which is not possible with 3D coordinates. Points at infinity occur when $W=0$. If you try to convert a $W=0$ homogeneous coordinate into a normal $W=1$ coordinate, it results in a bunch of divide-by-zero operations:  $$ \frac{1}{0}(2,3,4,0) = (\frac{2}{0}, \frac{3}{0}, \frac{4}{0}, \frac{0}{0})$$. This means that homogeneous coordinates with $W=0$ can not be converted back into 3D coordinates. What use does this have? Well, directional lights can be thought of as point lights that are infinitely far away. When a point light is infinitely far away, the rays of light become parallel, and all of the light travels in a single direction. This is basically the definition of a directional light. So, traditionally, in 3D graphics, directional lights are differentiated from point lights by the value of $W$ in the position vector of the light. If $W=1$, then it is a point light. If $W=0$, then it is a directional light. This is more of a traditional convention, rather than a useful way to write lighting code. Directional lights and point lights are usually implemented with separate code, because they behave differently. Summary: Homogeneous coordinates have an extra dimension called $W$, which scales the $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ dimensions. Matrices for translation and perspective projection can only be applied to homogeneous coordinates, which is why they are so common in 3D computer graphics. The $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ values are said to be correct when $W=1$. Any homogeneous coordinates can be converted to have $W=1$ by dividing all four dimensions by the $W$ value, except if $W=0$. When $W=0$, the coordinate represents a point at infinity (a vector with infinite length), and this is often used to denote the direction of directional lights.

    "title": "3D Rigid Body Motion (Part 1)",
    "body": "Introduction: In this article, I will introduce one of the fundamental problems of visual SLAM: How to describe a rigid body’s motion in 3-dimensional space ? Intuitively, we certainly know that this consists of one rotation plus one translation . The translation part does not really have any problems, but the rotation part is questionable. I will introduce the meaning of rotation matrices, quaternions, Euler angles and how they are computed and transformed. Rotation Matrix: Points, Vectors, and Coordinate Systems: The space of our daily life is 3-dimensional, so we are born to be used to 3D movements. The 3D space consists of three axes, so the position of one spatial point can be specified by three coordinates. However, we should now consider a rigid body , which has its position and orientation . The camera can also be viewed as a rigid body in three dimensions, so what we care about in Visual SLAM are the problem of the camera’s position and orientation. Combined, we can say, “the camera is at the $(0,0,0)$ point, facing the front”. Let’s describe this in a mathematical term. We start from the basic content: points and vectors. Points are the basic element in space, no length, no volume. Connecting the two points forms a vector. A vector can be thought of as an arrow pointing from one point to another. Here we need to warn you not to confuse the vector with its coordinates. A vector is one thing in space, such as $a$. Here, $a$ does not need to be associated with several real numbers. We can naturally talk about the plus or minus operation of two vectors, without relating to any real numbers. Only when we specify a coordinate system in this 3D space can we talk about the vector’s coordinates in this system, finding several real numbers corresponding to this vector. With the knowledge of linear algebra, the coordinates of a point in 3D space can be described as $\mathbb{R}^3$. How to do we describe this? Suppose that in this linear space, we fined a set of base $(e_1, e_2, e_3)$ , then, an arbitrary vector $a$ has a coordinate under this base: $$ a = \begin{bmatrix} e_1 &amp; e_2 &amp; e_3 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{bmatrix} = a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + a_3 e_3 $$. Here, $(a_1, a_2, a_3)^T$ is called $a$’s coordinates. The coordinates’ specific values are related to the vector itself and the selection of the bases. In $\mathbb{R}^3$, the coordinate system usually consists of $3$ orthogonal coordinate axes (it can also be non-orthogonal, but it is rare in practice). For example, given $x$ and $y$ axis, the $z$ axis can be determined using the right-hand (or left-hand) rule. According to different definitions, the coordinate system is divided into left-handed and right-handed. The third axis of the left-hand rule is opposite to the right-hand rule. Most 3D libraries use right-handed coordinates. Based on basic linear algebra knowledge, we can talk about the operations between vectors/vectors, vectors/numbers, such as scalar multiplication, vector addition, subtraction, inner product, outer product and so on. For $a,b \in \mathbb{R}^3$, the inner product of $a,b$ can be written as: \$\$ a \cdot b = a^Tb = \sum_{i=1}^3 a_i b_i = |a\||b| \cos(&lt;a,b&gt;)\$\$where $ &lt;a. b&gt; $ refers to the angle between the vector $a, b$. The inner product can also describe the projection relationship between vectors. $$ a \times b = \begin{Vmatrix} e_1 &amp; e_2 &amp; e_3 \\ a_1 &amp; a_2 &amp; a_3 \\ b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; b_3 \end{Vmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a_2b_3 - a_3 b_2 \\ a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \\ a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -a_3 &amp; a_2 \\ a_3 &amp; 0 &amp; -a_1 \\ -a_2 &amp; a_1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} b = a \wedge b$$. The result of the outer product is a vector whose direction is perpendicular to the two vectors, and the length is $|a||b|\sin(&lt;a,b&gt;)$, which is also the area of the quadrilateral of the two vectors. From the outer product operation, we introduce the $\wedge$ operator here, which means writing $a$ as a skew-symmetric matrix . You can take $\wedge$ as a skew-symmetric symbol. It turns the outer product $a \times b$ into the multiplication of the matrix and the vector $a \wedge b$ is a linear operation. This symbol will be used frequently in the following sections. It is a one-to-one mapping, meaning that for any vector, it corresponds to a unique anti-symmetric matrix, and vice versa: [a \wedge = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -a_3 &amp; a_2 \ a_3 &amp; 0 &amp; -a_1 \ -a_2 &amp; a_1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}] At the same time, note that the vector operations such as addition, subtraction, inner and outer products can be calculated even when we do not have their coordinates. For example, although the inner product can be expressed by the sum of the two vectors’ product when we know the coordinates, the length and angle can also be calculated even if their coordinates are unknown. Therefore, the inner product result of the two vectors is independent of the selection of the coordinate system. Euclidean Transforms between Coordinate Systems: We often define a variety of coordinate systems in the real scene. In robotics, you define one coordinate system for each link and joint; in 3D mapping, we also define a coordinate system for each cuboid and cylinder. If we consider a moving robot, it is common practice to set a stationary inertial coordinate system (or world coordinate system), such as the $x_W, y_W, z_W$ defined in the picture above. Meanwhile, the camera or robot is a moving coordinate system, such as coordinate system defined by $x_C, y_C, z_C$. We might ask: a vector $p$ in the camera system may have coordinates $p_c$; and in the world coordinate system, its coordinates maybe $p_w$ .  Then what is the conversion between two coordinates? It is necessary to first obtain the coordinate values of the point in the camera system and then use the transform rule to do the coordinate transform. We need a mathematical way to describe this transformation. As we will see later, we can describe it with a transform matrix $T$. Intuitively, the motion between two coordinate systems consists of a rotation plus a translation , which is called rigid body motion . Obviously, the camera movement is rigid. During the rigid body motion, the length and angle of the vector will not change. Imagine that you throw your phone into the air and there may be differences in spatial position and orientation. But the length and the angle of each face will not change. At this point, we say that the phone’s motion is Euclidean. The Euclidean transform consists of rotation and translation . Let’s first consider the rotation. We have a unit-length orthogonal base $(e_1, e_2, e_3)$. After a rotation it becomes $(e_1’, e_2’, e_3’)$. Then, for the same vector $a$ (the vector does not move with the rotation of the coordinate system). its coordinates in these two coordinate systems are $[a_1, a_2, a_3]^T$ and $[a_1’, a_2’, a_3]^T$. Because the vector itself has not changed, according to the definition of coordinates, there are: [[e_1, e_2, e_3] \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \ a_2 \ a_3 \end{bmatrix} = [e_1’, e_2’, e_3’] \begin{bmatrix} a_1’ \ a_2’ \ a_3’ \end{bmatrix}] To describe the relationship between the two coordinates, we multiply the left and right side of the above equation by $\begin{bmatrix} e_1^T \\ e_2^T \\ e_3^T \end{bmatrix}$, then the matrix on the left becomes an identity matrix, so: $$\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{bmatrix} \triangleq Ra’$$. We take the intermediate matrix out and define it as a matrix $R$. This matrix consists of the inner product between the two sets of bases, describing the same vector’s coordinate transformation relationship before and after the rotation. It can be said that the matrix $R$ describes the rotation itself . So we call it the rotation matrix. Meanwhile, the components of the matrix are the inner product of the two coordinate system bases. Since the base vector’s length is $1$, it is actually the cosine of the angle between the base vectors. So this matrix is also called direction cosine matrix. The rotation matrix has some special properties.  In fact, it is an orthogonal matrix with a determinant of $1$. Conversely, an orthogonal matrix with a determinant of 1 is also a rotation matrix. So you can define a set of $n$ dimensional rotation matrices as follows:       $$SO(n) = \{ R \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}   RR^T = I, det(R) =1 \} $$   $SO(n)$ refers to the special orthogonal group. This set consists of a rotation matrix of $n$ dimensional space, in particular, $SO(3)$ refers to the rotation of the three-dimensional space. In this way, we can talk directly about the rotation transformation between the two coordinate systems without having to start from the bases. Since the rotation matrix is orthogonal, its inverse (i. e. , transpose) describes an opposite rotation. According to the above definition, there are: [a’ = R^{-1}a = R^Ta] Obviously, the $R^T$ represents an opposite rotation. In the Euclidean transformation, there is a translation in addition to rotation. Consider the vector $a$ in the world coordinate system. After a rotation (depicted by $R$) and a translation of $t$, we get $a’$. Then we can put the rotation and translation together, and have:$$a’= Ra+t$$,where $t$ is called a translation vector. Compared to the rotation, the translation part simply adds the translation vector to the coordinates after the rotation , which si very simple. By the above formula, we completely describe the coordinate transformation relationship using a rotation matrix $R$ and a translation vector $t$. In practice, we may define the coordinate system 1 and 2, then the vector $a$ under the two coordinates is $a_1, a_2$. The relationship between the two systems should be: $$a_1 = R_{12} a_2 + t_{12}$$. Here, $R_{12}$ means the “rotation of the vector from system 2 to system 1”. About $t_{12}$, readers may just take it as a translation vector without wondering about its physical meaning. In fact, it corresponds to a vector from the system 1’s origin pointing to system 2’s origin, and the coordinates are taken under tsystem 1. So I suggest you to understand it as “a vector from 1 to 2”. But the reverse $t_{21}$, which is a vector from $2$’s origin to $1$’s origin, whose coordinates are taken in system $2$, is not equal to $-t_{12}$. It is also related to the rotation of the two systems. Therefore, when beginners ask the question “What are my coordinates?”, we need to clearly explain this sentence’s meaning. Here, “my coordinates” normally refers to the vector from the world system $W$ pointing to the origin of the camera system $C$, and then take the coordinates in the world’s base. Corresponding to the mathematical symbol, it should be the value of $t_{WC}$. For the same reason, it is not $-t_{CW}$ but actually $-R^T_{CW} t_{CW}$. Transform Matrix and Homogeneous Coordinates: The formula $a’ = Ra+t$ fully expresses the rotation and the translation of Euclidean space, but there is still a small problem: the transformation relationship here is not a linear relationship. Suppose we made two transformations: $R_1,t_1$ and $R_2,t_2$:$$b = R_1 a + t_1, c = R_2 b + t_2$$. So the transformation from $a$ to $c$ is: $$c = R_2 (R_1 a + t_1) + t_2$$. This form is not elegant after multiple transformations. Therefore, we introduce homogeneous coordinates and transformation matrices, rewriting the formula:$$ \begin{bmatrix} a’ \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} R &amp; t \\ 0^T &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \triangleq T \begin{bmatrix} a \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$. This is a mathematical trick: we add $1$ at the end of the 3D vector and turn it into a 4D vector called homogeneous coordinates. For this four-dimensional vector, we can write the rotation and translation matrix, making the whole relationship a linear relationship. In this formula, the matrix $T$ is called transform matrix. We temporarily use $\tilde{a}$ to represent the homogeneous coordinates of $a$. Then, relying on homogeneous coordinates and transformation matrices, the superposition of the two transformations can have a good form: $$\tilde{b} = T_1 \tilde{a}, \tilde{c} = T_2 \tilde{b} \Rightarrow T_2 T_1 \tilde{a}$$. But the symbols that distinguish between homogeneous and non-homogeneous coordinates are annoying, because here we only need to add 1 at the end of the vector or remove 1 to turn it into a normal vector. So, without ambiguity, we will write it directly as $b = Ta$ and by default we just assume a homogeneous coordinate conversion is made if needed. The transformation matrix $T$ has a special structure: the upper left corner is the rotation matrix, the right side is the translation vector, the lower-left corner is $0$ vector, and the lower right corner is $1$. This set of transform matrix is also known as the special Euclidean group: $$SE(3) = \{ T = \begin{bmatrix} R &amp; t \\ 0^T &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{4 \times 4}| R \in SO(3), t \in \mathbb{R}^3 \}$$. Like $SO(3)$, the inverse of the transformation matrix represents an inverse transformation: $$T^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} R^T &amp; -R^T t \\ 0^T &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}$$. Again, we use the notation of $T_{12}$ to represent a transformation from 2 to 1. Because the conversion between homogeneous and non-homogeneous coordinates is actually very easy, it is assumed that the conversion from homogeneous coordinates to normal coordinates is already done. Summary: First, we introduced the vector and its coordinate representation and introduced the operation between the vectors; then, the motion between the coordinate systems is described by the Euclidean transformation, which consists of translation and rotation. The rotation can be described by the rotation matrix $SO(3)$, while the translation is directly described by an $\mathbb{R}^3$ vector. Finally, if the translation and rotation are placed in a matrix, the transformation matrix $SE(3)$ is formed. References:  Introduction to Visual SLAM"

    "title": "Depth Estimation: Basics and Intuition",
    "body": " Depth Estimation in Computer Vision : Depth estimation is also known as the inverse problem , where we seek to recover unknowns given insufficient information. So how do machines actually perceive depth? The earliest algorithm with impressive results began with depth estimation using stereo vision back in the 90s. A lot of progress was made on dense stereo correspondence algorithm Researchers were able to utilize geometry to constrain and replicate the idea of stereopsis mathematically. As for monocular depth estimation, it recently started to gain popularity by using neural networks. We will talk about this shortly after discussing stereo vision.  Depth Estimation from Stereo Vision : The main idea of solving depth using a stereo camera involves the concept of triangulation and streo matching . The former depends on good calibration and rectification to constrain the problem so that it can be modelled on a 2D plane known as epipolar plane . Epipolar plane greatly reduces the stereo matching problem to a line search along the epipolar line. Once we are able to match pixel correspondences between 2 views, the next task is to obtain a representation that encodes the difference .  This representation is known as disparity . The formula to obtain depth from disparity can be worked out from similar triangles.  Why is Measuring Depth So Difficult? : Before we move on, let’s try to understand some fundamental problems of depth estimation. The main culprit lies in the projection of 3D views to 2D images where depth information is lost . Another problem is deeply seeded when there are motion and moving objects .  Depth Estimation is Ill-Posed : Estimating depth from a single RGB image is an ill-posed inverse problem. What this means is that many 3D scenes observed in the 3D world can indeed correspond to the same 2D image plane.  Scale Ambiguity for Monocular Depth Estimation : The uncertain scale factor require current methods to have an additional sensor like LiDAR to provide depth ground-truth or stereo camera as additional training input, which makes them difficult to implement. Note that this issue exists only for monocular-based techniques , as the scale can be recovered for a stereo rig with a known baseline.

    "title": "Dissecting the Camera Matrix (Part 1)",
    "body": " Camera Calibration and Decomposition : Primarily, camera calibration is about finding the quantities internal to the camera that affect the imaging process. Here are some of the factors that will be taken care of:  image center : we need to find the position of the image center in the image. Wait, isn't the image center located at $(width/2, height/2)$? Well, no. Unless we calibrate the camera, the image will almost always appear to be off-center.  focal length : this is a very important parameter. Remember how people using DSLR cameras tend to focus on things before capturing the image? this parameter is directly related to the focus of the camera and it is very critical.  scaling factors : the scaling factors for row pixels and column pixels might be different. If we don't take care of this thing, the image will look stretched (either horizontally or vertically).  skew factor : this refers to shearing. the image will look like a parallelogram otherwise.  lens distortion : this refers to the pseudo zoom effect that we see near the center of any image.  shearing refers to a transformation in which all points along a given line $L$ remain fixed while other points are shifted parallel to $L$ by a distance proportional to their perpendicular distance from $L$.  Pinhole Camera Model : Before we jump into anything, let's see where this all began. When we capture an image, we are basically mapping the 3D scene to a 2D scene. It means that every point in the 3D world gets mapped to the 2D plane of our image. This is called the pinhole camera model . It basically describes the relationship between the coordinates of the 3D point and its projection on the 2D image. This, of course, is the ideal case where there is absolutely no distortion of any kind. Every camera is modeled based on this, and every camera aspires to simulate this as close as possible. But in the real world, we have to deal with things like geometric distortions, blurring, finite sized apertures, etc. The figure shown here depicts a pinhole camera model. The camera is placed at the origin $O$. The point $P$ represents a point in the real world. We are trying to capture that onto a 2D plane. The image plane represents the 2D plane that you get after capturing the image. The image plane actually contains the image that you see after capturing a picture. So basically, we are trying to map every 3D point to a point on the image plane. In this case, the point $P$ gets mapped to $P_c$. The distance between the origin $O$ and this image plane is called the focal length of the camera. This is the parameter you modify when you adjst the focus of the camera.  Intrinsic and Extrinsic Parameters : In the above figure, we want to estimate $(u,v)$ from $(X,Y,Z)$. Let's say the focal length is denoted by $f$. If you look at the triangle formed using the origin-$P_c$-and the $Z$-axis with the origin-$P$ and $Z$-axis, you will notice that they are similar triangles. This means that $u$ depends on the $f$, $X$ and $Z$. Similarly, $v$ depends on $f$, $Y$ and $Z$. $$\displaylines{u = fX/Z \\\v = fY/Z}$$Next, if the origin of the 2D image coordinate system does not coincide with where the $Z$-axis intersects the image plane, we need to translate $P_c$ into the desired origin. Let this translation be defined by $(t_u, t_v)$. So now, $u$ and $v$ are given by:$$\displaylines{u = fX/Z + t_u \\\v = fY/Z + t_v}$$So up until now, we have something that can translate $(X,Y,Z)$ to $(u,v)$. Let's denote this matrix $M$. So we can write:$$ P_c = MP$$Since this is a camera image, we need to express it in inches. For this, we will need to know the resolution of the camera in pixels/inch. If the pixels are square the resolution will be identical in both $u$ and $v$ directions of the camera image coordinates. However, for a more general case, we assume rectangular pixels with resolution $m_u$ and $m_v$ pixels/inch in $u$ and $v$ directions respectively. Therefore, to measure $P_c$ in pixels, its $u$ and $v$ coordinates should be multiplied by $m_u$ and $m_v$ respectively. So now, this new transformation matrix depends on $f, X, Y, Z, t_u, t_v, m_u, m_v$. Let's denote this by:$$P_c = KP$$Here, $K$ is called the intrinsic parameter matrix for the camera. Now, if the camera does not have its center of projection at $(0,0,0)$ and is oriented in an arbitrary fashion (not necessarily $z$-perpendicular to the image plane), then we need roation and translation to make the camera coordinate system coincide with the configuration in that pinhole camera figure. Let the rotation applied to coincide the principal axis with $Z$-axis given by a $3 \times 3$ rotation matrix $R$. Then the matrix is formed by first applying the translation followed by the rotation is given by the $3 \times 4$ matrix. $$E = \\( R|RT \\)$$This is called the extrinsic parameter matrix for the camera . So, the complete camera transformation can now be represented as: $$ K \\( R|RT \\) = KR \\( I|T \\)$$Hence, $P_c$ the projection of $P$ is given by:$$P\_c = KR \\( I|T \\) P = CP$$$C$ is a $3 \times 4$ matrix usually called the complete camera calibration matrix. So basically, camera calibration matrix is used to transform a 3D point in the real world to a 2D point on the image plane considering all the things like focal length of the camera, distortion, resolution, shifting of origin, etc.  References :  ksimek blog prateekvjoshi blog "

    "body": " 🌟 3D Reconstruction from 2D Signals : We are going to look at depth estimation as a multi-view problem. Multi-view problems can span into different domains including stereo vision, Structure from Motion and optical flow. Although each carries great importance in the problem of Virtual Reality (VR) and robotics, we will focus on stereo vision in this multi-part series. Specifically, the progress of deep learning in stereo vision technology. How can we automatically compute 3D geometry from images ? What cues in the image provide 3D information? Before looking at binocular, let’s consider single view characteristics. Well, we humans do so naturally. Here are several cues we use to infer depth information: shading texture  focus motion  perspective occlusion  symmetry Nonetheless, structure and depth are inherently ambiguous from a single view. As seen from the optical center (i. e. , camera location), $P1$ and $P2$ are projected onto the image plane as equivalent.  The Stereo Problem : Stereo vision systems reference the knowledge of two images captured simultaneously from a pair of cameras (left and right) with camera parameters (extrinsic and intrinsic). Stereo is heavily motivated by biology. Classic stereo problem include disparity, depth, occlusion, Structure from Motion, motion parallax etc. Provided left and right images, the ambiguity problem of the aforementioned is satisfied via triangulation from the two image planes by matching correspondences of a point in the world coordinate to the ones that can be seen in both images. The basic principle of triangulation is shown above: the reconstruction via the intersection of two rays. Requirements? Calibration and correspondences. Furthermore,  the Epipolar Constraint reduces the correspondence problem to $1D$ search along conjugate epipolar lines shown in the above figure. Thus, Epipolar Constraint assumes that stereo pairs are rectified images, meaning the same epipolar line aligns across rows such that it is orthogonal to both and aligned with one another. Rectification is achieved by learning a transformation based on intrinsic and extrinsic parameters: a process that dates back several decades. From the rectified image pair, the depth $Z$ can be determined by its inversely proportionate relationhip with disparity $d$, where the disparity is defined as the pixel difference along the horizontal when comparing correspondences of left and right. This can be written as: [I(x,y) = D(x+d, y)] This relationship is easiest to grasp visually. Provided a point in the left image plane $P_L(x,y)$ along with the correspondence in the right image plane and the world coordinates $(X,Y,Z)$ projected as a point in a 3D scene, our goal is to reconstruct the missing $Z$ (depth) provided the stereo pair. We set the relative coordinates (red axis) along with having known baseline $b$ between the two camera centers. Then $/frac{x_L}{f}$ can be expressed as $\frac{X+b/2}{Z}$ and $\frac{x_R}{f} = \frac{X-b/2}{Z}$. Therefore, [\frac{y_L}{f} = \frac{y_R}{f} = \frac{Y}{Z}] and the world coordinate can be expressed as [X = \frac{b(x_L+x_R)}{2(x_L - x_R)} Y = \frac{b(y_L + y_R}{2(x_L-x_R} Z = \frac{bf}{(x_L - x_R)}] $d = x_L - x_R$ is the disparity between corresponding left and right image points References :  article from medium "

    "title": "Batch Normalization and Group Normalization",
    "body": " Batch Normalization: the Principles : Batch Normalization is an algorithmic method which makes the training of Deep Neural Networks faster and more stable . Batch normalization is computed differently during the training and the testing phase. At training , the BN layer determines the mean and standard deviation of the activation values across the batch. It then normalizes the activation vector with $\mu$ and $\sigma$. That way, each neuron’s output follows a standard normal distribution across the batch . It finally applies a linear transformation with $\gamma$ and $\beta$ which are the two trainable parameters. Such step allows the model to choose the optimum distribution for each hidden layer. $\gamma$ allows to adjust the standard deviation while $\beta$ allows to adjust the bias, shifting the curve on the right or on the left side. At each iteration, the network computes the mean $\mu$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$ corresponding to the current batch. Then it trains $\gamma$ and $\beta$ through gradient descent using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to give more importance to the latest iterations.  We mostly use Exponential Moving Average algorithm to reduce the noise or to smooth the data. The weight of each element decreases progressively over time, meaning the EMA gives greater weight to recent data points . EMA reacts faster to changes compared to Simple Moving Average. At the evaluation phase , we may not have a full batch to feed into the model. To tackle this issue, we compute $\mu_{pop}$ and $\sigma_{pop}$ as the estimated mean and standard deviation of the studied population . Those values are computed using all the $\mu_{batch}$ and $\sigma_{batch}$ during training, and directly fed during the evaluation phase.  Why Normalization? : What we can conclude from the original Batch Normalization paper is that:  Adding BN layers leads to better convergence and higher accuracy  Adding BN layers allows us to use higher learning rate without compromising convergence. To quote Ian Goodfellow about the use of batch normalization: Before BN, we thought it was almost impossible to efficiently train deep models using sigmoid in the hidden layers. Batch Normalization makes those unstable networks trainable. In practice, it is widely admitted that: For CNNs, Batch Normalization is better  For Recurrent Networks, Layer Normalization is better While BN uses the current batch to normalize every single value, LN uses all the current layer to do so.  The normalization is performed using other features from a single example instead of using the same feature across all current batch examples. The best way to understand why BN works is to understand the optimization landscape smoothness . BN reparameterizes the underlying optimization problem , making the training faster and easier. In additional recent studies, researchers observed that this effect is not unique to BN, but applies to other normalization methods (i. e. L1 normalization or L2 normalization).  The Drawbacks of BN : For BN to work, the batch size is required to be sufficiently large , usually at least 32 . However, there are situations when we have to settle for a small batch size. For example, when each data sample is highly memory consuming or when we train a very large neural network which leaves little GPU memory for processing data. For computer vision applications other than image classification, the restriction on batch sizes are more demanding and it is difficult to have higher batch sizes.  Comparisions of Normalization Methods : Group Normalization is one of the latest normalization methods that avoids exploiting the batch dimension, thus is independent of batch size. But there are other normalization methods as well.  Layer Normalization : Layer Normalization computes $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i$ along the (C,H,W) axes. The computation for an input feature is entirely independent of other input features in a batch.  Instance Normalization : Instance Normalization computes $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i$ along the (H,W) axes. Since the computation of IN is the same as that of BN with batch_size=1, IN actually makes the situation worse in most cases. However, for style transfer tasks , IN is better at discarding contrast information of an image, thus having superior performance than BN.  Group Normalization : Also notice that IN can be viewed as applying Layer Normalization to each channel individually as if the num_channels = 1. Group Normalization is the middle ground between IN and LN. It organizes the channels into different groups and computes $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i$ along the (H,W) axes and along a group of channels. First, the batch with dimension (N,C,H,W) is reshaped to (N,G,C//G,H,W). The number of group $G$ is a pre-defined hyperparameter . Then we normalize along the (C//G,H,W) dimension and return the result after reshaping the batch back to (N,C,H,w). Group Normalization is better than Layer Normalization as GN allows different distribution to be learned for each group of channels. GN is also thought to be better than IN because GN can exploit the dependence across channels. If `C = G`, that is, if the number of groups are set to be equal to the number of channels, GN becomes IN . Likewise, if `G = 1` GN becomes LN .

    "title": "Guide to Linear Algebra (Part 1)",
    "body": " Computational Linear Algebra : This chapter covers the computational aspects of performing matrix calculations. Understanding matrix computations is important because all later chapters depend on them. Suppose we’re given a huge matrix $ A \in R^{n \times n} $ with $ n=1000 $. Hidden behind the innocent-looking mathematical notation of the matrix inverse $A^{-1}$, the matrix product $AA$, and the matrix determinant $ | A |$, lie monster coputations involving all the $1000 \times 1000 = 1$ million entries of the matrix $A$. Millions of arithmetic operations must be performed, so I hope you have at least a thousand pencil ready! Okay, calm down. I won’t actually make you calculate millions of arithmetic operations. In fact, to learn linear algebra, it is sufficient to know how to carry out calculations with $3 \times 3$ and $4 \times 4$ matrices. Even for such moderately sized matrices, computing products, inverses, and determinants by hand are serious computational tasks. If you’re ever required to take a linear algebra final exam, you need to make sure you can do these calculations quickly. Even if no exam looms in your imminent future, it’s important to practice matrix operations by hand to get a feel for them. This chapter will introduce you to the following computational tasks involving matrices: Gauss-Jordan elimination Suppose we're trying to solve two equations in two unknowns $x$ and $y$:$$ \displaylines{ax+by = c \\\dx+ ey= f}$$If we add $\alpha$\times the first equation to the second equation, we obtain an equivalent system of equations:$$\displaylines{ax + by = c \\\(d + \alpha a)x + (e + \alpha b)y = f + \alpha c}$$This is called a row operation : we added $\alpha$-times the first row to the second row. Row operations change the coefficient of the system of equations, but leave the solution unchanged. Gauss-Jordan elimination is a systematic procedure for solving systems of linear equations using row operations.  Matrix product The product $AB$ between matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times l}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{l \times n}$ is the matrix $C \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ whose coefficients $c_{ij}$ are defined by the formula $c_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{l}a_{ik}b_{kj}$ for all $i \in \lbrack 1, \dots, m \rbrack $ and $j \in \lbrack 1, \dots, n \rbrack $. We'll soon unpack this formula and learn about its intuitive interpretation: that computing $C = AB$ is computing all the dot products between the rows of $A$ and the columns of $B$.  Determinant The determinant of a matrix $A$, denoted $|A|$ is an operation that gives us useful information about the linear independence of the rows of the matrix. The determinant is connected to many notions of linear algebra: linear independence, geometry of vectors, solving systems of equations, and matrix invertibility. We'll soon discuss these aspects.  Matrix inverse We'll build upon our knowledge of Gauss-Jordan elimination, matrix products, and determinants to derive three different procedures for computing the matrix inverse $A^{-1}$. Reduced Row Echelon Form : In this section, we’ll learn to solve systems of linear equations using the Gauss-Jordan elimination procedure. A system of equations can be represented as a matrix of coefficients. The Gauss-Jordan elimination procedure converts any matrix into its  reduced row echelon form (RREF) . We can easily find the solution (or solutions of the system of equations from the RREF. Listen up: the material covered in this section requires your full on, caffeinated attention, as the procedures you’ll learn are somewhat tedious. Gauss-Jordan elimination involves many repetitive mathematical manipulations of arrays of numbers. It’s important you hang in there and follow through the step-by-step manipulations, as well as verify each step I present on your own with pen and paper.  Solving Equations : Suppose you’re asked to solve the following system of equations: [\displaylines{1x_1 + 2x_2 = 5 \3x_1 + 9x_2 = 21}] The standard approach is to use one of the equation-solving tricks we learned to combine the equations and find the values of the two unknowns $x_1$ and $x_2$. Observe that the names of the two unknowns are irrelevant to the solution of the system of equations. Indeed, the solution $(x_1, x_2)$ to the above system of equations is the same as the solution $(s,t)$ to the system of equations [\displaylines{1s+ 2t = 5 \3s+ 9t = 21}] The important parts of a system of linear equations are the coefficients in front of the variables and the constants on the right-hand side of each equation.  Augmented Matrix : The system of linear equations can be written as an augmented matrix : [\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 5 \        3 &amp; 9 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 21\end{pmatrix}] The first column corresponds to the coefficients of the first variable, the second column is for the second variable, and the last column corresponds to the constants of the right-hand side. It is customary to draw a vertical line where the equal signs in the equations would normally appear. This line helps distinguish the coefficients of the equations from the column of constants on the right-hand side. Once we have the augmented matrix, we can simplify it by using row operations (which we’ll discuss shortly) on its entries. After simplification by row operations, the augmented matrix will be transformed to [\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 5 \0 &amp; 1 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 2\end{pmatrix}] which corresponds to the system of equations [\displaylines{x_1 = 1 \x_2 = 2}] This is a trivial system of equations; there is nothing left to solve and we can see that the solutions are $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 2$. This example illustrates the general idea of the Gauss-Jordan elimination procedure for solving the system of equations by manipulating an augmented matrix.  Row Operations : We can manipulate the rows of an augmented matrix without changing its solutions. We’re allowed to perform the following three types of row operations: Add a multiple of one row to another row Swap the position of the two rows Multiply a row by a constant Let’s trace the sequence of row operations needed to solve the system of equations [\displaylines{x_1 + 2x_2 = 5 \3x_1 + 9x_2 = 21}] starting from its augmented matrix: [\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 5 \3 &amp; 2 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 21\end{pmatrix}]  As a first step, we eliminate the first variable in the second row by subtracting three times the first row from the second row. [\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 5 \0 &amp; 3 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 6\end{pmatrix}] We denote this row operation as $R_2 \leftarrow R_2 - 3R_1$.  To simplify the second row, we divide it by 3 to obtain[\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 5 \0 &amp; 1 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix}] This row operation is denoted $R_2 \leftarrow \frac{1}{3}R_2$.  The final step is to eliminate the second variable from the first row. We do this by subtracting two times the second row from the first row $R_1 \leftarrow R_1 - 2 R_2$:[\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 1 \0 &amp; 1 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 2\end{pmatrix}] We can now read off the solution: $x_1 =1$ and $x_2 = 2$. Note how we simplified the augmented matrix through a specific procedure: we followed the Gauss-Jordan elimination algorithm to bring the matrix into its reduced row echelon form. The reduced row echelon form (RREF) is the simplest form for an augmented matrix. Each row contains a leading one (a numeral 1) also known as a pivot . Each column’s pivot is used to eliminate the numbers that lie below and above it in the same column. The end result of this procedure is the reduced row echelon form: [\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; \ast &amp; 0 &amp;\bigm | \ast \0 &amp; 1 &amp; \ast &amp; 0 &amp;\bigm | \ast \0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp;\bigm | \ast\end{pmatrix}] Note the matrix contains only zero entries below and above the pivots. The asterisks $\ast$ denote arbitrary numbers that could not be eliminated because no leading one is present in these columns. The solution to a system of linear equations in the variables $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is the set of values $\{(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)\}$ that satisfy all the equations. Gaussian elimination is the process of bringing a matrix into row echelon form.  A matrix is said to be in row echelon form (REF) if all entries below the leading ones are zero. This form can be obtained by adding or subtracting the row with the leading one from the rows below it.  Gaussian-Jordan elimination is the process of bringing a matrix into reduced row echelon form.  A matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form (RREF) if all the entries below and above the pivots are zero. Starting from the REF, we obtain the RREF by subtracting the row containing the pivots from the rows above them. the rank of the matrix $A$ is the number of pivots in the RREF of $A$.  Number of Solutions : A system of linear equations in three variables could have: one solution If the RREF of a matrix has a pivot in each row, we can read off the values of the solution by inspection. $$\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; c_1 \\\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; c_2 \\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; c_3\end{bmatrix}$$The unique solution is $x_1 = c_1$, $x_2 = c_2$, and $x_3 = c_3$.  Infinitely many solutions 1 If one of the equations is redundant, a row of zeros will appear when the matrix is brought to the RREF. This happens when one of the original equations is a linear combination of the other two. In such cases, we're really solving two equations in three variables, so can't pin down one of the unknown variables. We say the solution contains a free variable . For example, consider the following RREF:$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; a_1 &amp; c_1 \\\0 &amp; 1 &amp; a_2 &amp; c_2 \end{bmatrix}$$The column that doesn't contain a leading one corresponds to the free variable. To indicate that $x_3$ is a free variable, we give it a special label $x_3 \equiv t$. The variable $t$ could be any number $t \in \mathbb{R}$. In other words, when we say $t$ is free, it means $t$ can take on any value from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$. The information in the augmented matrix can now be used to express $x_1$ and $x_2$ in terms of the right-hand constants and the free variable $t$:$$\begin{Bmatrix} x_1 = c_1 - a_1 t \\ x_2 = c_2 - a_2 t \\ x_3 = t, \forall t \in \mathbb{R} \end{Bmatrix} = \begin{Bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + t \begin{bmatrix} -a_1 \\ -a_2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \forall t \in \mathbb{R}\end{Bmatrix}$$. The solution corresponds to the equation of a line passing through the point $(c_1, c_2, 0)$ with direction vector $(-a_1, -a_2, 1)$. We'll discuss the geometry of lines in the next section. For now, it's important that you understand that a system of equations can have more than one solution; any point on the line $l \equiv \{(c_1, c_2, 0) + t(-a_1, -a_2, 1), \forall t \in \mathbb{R}\}$ is a solution to the above system of equations.  Infinitely many solutions 2 It's also possible to obtain a two-dimensional solution space. This happens when two of the three equations are redundant. In this case, there will be a single leading one, and thus two free variables. For example, in the RREF$$\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; a_1 &amp; c_1 \\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}$$the variables $x_1$ and $x_3$ are free. As in the previous infinitely-many-solutions case, we define new labels for the free variables $x_1 \equiv s$ and $x_3 \equiv t$, where $ s \in \mathbb{R}$ and $t \in \mathbb{R}$ are two arbitrary numbers. The solution to this system of equations is $$ \begin{Bmatrix} x_1 = s \\ x_2 = c_2 - a_2 t \\ x_3 = t , \\ \forall s,t \in \mathbb{R} \end{Bmatrix} = \begin{Bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ c_2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + s \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + t \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -a_2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \forall s,t \in \mathbb{R} \end{Bmatrix} $$This solution set corresponds to the parametric equation of a plane that contains the point $(0,c_2, 0)$ and the vectors $(1,0,0)$ and $(0, -a_2, 1)$. The general equation for the solution plane is $0x+1y+a_2z = c_2$, as can be observed from the first row of the augmented matrix. In the next section, we'll learn more about the geometry of planes and how to convert between their general and parametric forms.  no solutions If there are no numbers $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ that simultaneously satisfy all three equations, the system of equations has no solution. An example of a system of equations with no solution is the pair $ s+t = 4$ and $s+t = 44$. There are no numbers $(s,t)$ that satisfy both these equations. A system of equations has no solution if its reduced row echelon form contains a row of zero coefficients with a nonzero constant in the right-hand side:$$\begin{Bmatrix}\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; c_1 \\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; c_2 \\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; c_3 \end{array}\end{Bmatrix}$$If $c_3 \neq 0$ this system of equations is impossible to satisfy. There is no solution because there are no numbers $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ such that $0x_1 + 0x_2 + 0x_3 = c_3$. Dear reader, we've reached the first moment in this book where you'll need to update your math vocabulary. The solution to an individual equation is a finite set of points. The solution to a system of equations can be an entire space containing infinitely many points, such as a line or a plane. The solution set of a system of three linear equations in three unknowns could be either the empty set $\{0\}$ (no solution), a set with one element $\{(x_1, x_2, x_3)\}$, or a set with infinitely many elements like a line $\{p_o + t \overrightarrow{v}, t \in \mathbb{R}\}$ or a plane $\{p_o + s \overrightarrow{v} + t \overrightarrow{w}, s,t \in \mathbb{R}\}$. Another possible solution set is all of $\mathbb{R}^3$; every vector $ \overrightarrow{x} \in \mathbb{R}^3 $ is a solution to the equation $$\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$Note the distinction between the three types of infinite solution sets. A line is one-dimensional, a plane is two-dimensional, and $\mathbb{R}^3$ is three-dimensional. Describing all points on a line requires one parameter, describing all points on a plane takes two parameters, and-of course-describing a point in $\mathbb{R}^3$ takes three parameters.  Geometric Interpretation : We can gain some intuition about solution sets by studying the geometry of the intersections of lines in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and planes in $\mathbb{R}^3$.  Lines in two dimensions : Equations of the form $ax+by = c$ corresponds to lines in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Solving systems of linear equations of the form$$\displaylines{a_1 x + b_1 y = c_1 \\\a_2 x + b_2 y = c_2}$$requires finding the point $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ where these lines intersect. There are three possibilities for the solution set:- one solution if the two lines intersect at a point. - infinitely many solutions if the lines are superimposed. - no solution if the two lines are parallel and never intersect. Planes in three dimensions : Equations of the form $ax+by+cz = d$ correspond to planes in $\mathbb{R}^3$. When solving three such equations, $$ \displaylines{a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z = d_1 \\\a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z = d_2 \\\a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z = d_3}$$we want to find a set of points $(x,y,z)$ that satisfy all three equations simultaneously. There are four possibilities for the solution set:1.  one solution three non-parallel planes intersect at a point. 2.  infinitely many solutions 1 if only one of the plane equations is redundant, the solution corresponds to the intersection of two planes which is a line. 3.  infinitely many solutions 2 if two of the equations are redundant, then the solution space is a two-dimensional space. 4.  if two (or more) of the planes are parallel, they will never intersect.  Determinants : Overview : What is the volume of a rectangular box of length $1m$, width $2$ and height $3m$? It's easy to compute the volume of this box because its shape is right rectangular prism. The volume of this prism is $V = l \times w \times h = 6m^3$. What if the shape of the box was a parallelpiped instead? A parallelpiped is a box whose opposite faces are parallel but whose sides are slanted. How do we compute the volume of a parallelpiped? The determinant operation, specifically the $3 \times 3$ determinant, is the perfect tool for this purpose. The determinant of a matrix, denoted $det(A)$ or $|A|$, is a particular way to multiply the entries of the matrix to produce a single number. We use determinants for all kinds of tasks: to compute areas and volumes, to solve systems of linear equations, to check whether a matrix is invertible or not, etc. We can interpret the determinant of a matrix intuitively as a geometrical calculation. The determinant is the volume of the geometric shape whose edges are the rows of the matrix. For $2 \times 2$ matrices, the determinant corresponds to the area of a parallelogram. For $3 \times 3$ matices, the determinant corresponds to the volume of a parallelpiped. For dimensions $d &gt; 3$, we say the determinant measures a $d$-dimensional hyper-volume . Consider the linear transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ defined through the matrix-vector product with a matrix $A_T: T(\overrightarrow{x}) \equiv A_T \overrightarrow{x}$. The determinant of the matrix $A_T$ is the scale factor associated with the linear transformation $T$. The scale factor of the linear transformation $T$ describes how the area of a unit square in the input space (a square with dimensions $1 \times 1$) is transformed by $T$ . After passing through $T$, the unit square is transformed to a parallelogram with with area $det(A_T)$. Linear transformations that shrink areas have $det(A_T) &lt; 1$, while linear transformations that enlarge areas have $det(A_T) &gt; 1$. A linear transformation that is area preserving has $det(A+T) = 1$. The determinant is also used to check linear independence for a given set of vectors. We construct a matrix using the vectors as the matrix rows , and compute its determinant. The determinant of a matrix tells us whether or not that matrix is invertible . If $det(A) \neq 0$, then $A$ is invertible; if $det(A) = 0$, $A$ is not invertible. The determinant shares a connection with the vector cross product , and is used in the definition of the eigenvalue equation . Formulas : The determinant of a $2 \times 2$ matrix is $$det(\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \end{bmatrix}) = \begin{vmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \end{vmatrix} = a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}a{21}$$The formulas for the determinants of larger matrices are defined recursively. For example, the determinant of $3 \times 3$ matirx is defined in terms of $2 \times 2$ determinants:$$ \begin{vmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} \\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \end{vmatrix} = a_{11} = a_{11} \begin{vmatrix}a_{22} &amp; a_{23} \\ a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \end{vmatrix} -a_{12} \begin{vmatrix} a_{21} &amp; a_{23} \\ a_{31} &amp; a_{33} \end{vmatrix}+ a_{13} \begin{vmatrix} a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} \end{vmatrix}$$ There's a neat computational trick for computing $3 \times 3$ determinants by hand. The trick consists of extending the matrix $A$ into a $3 \times 5$ array that contains copies the columns of $A$: the $1^{st}$ column of $A$ is copied to the $4^{th}$ column of the extended array, and the $2^{nd}$ column of $A$ is copied to the $5^{th}$ column. The determinant is then computed by summing the products of the entries on the three positive diagonals and subtracting the products of the entries on the three negative diagonals. The general formula for the determinant of an $n \times n$ matrix is$$det(A) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} (-1)^{1+j} a_{1j} M_{1j}$$where $M_{ij}$ is called the minor associated with the entry $a_{ij}$. The minor $M_{ij}$ is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing the $i^{th}$ row and the $j^{th}$ column of the matrix $A$. Note the alternating factor $(-1)^{i+j}$ that changes value between $+1$ and $-1$ for different terms in the formula. The determinant of a $4 \times 4$ matrix $B$ is $$ det(B) = b_{11}M_{11} - b_{12}M_{12} + b_{13}M_{13} - b_{14}M_{14}$$The general formula for determinants $det(A) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} (-1)^{1+j} a_{1j} M_{1j}$ assumes we're expanding the determinant along the first row of the matrix. In fact, a determinant formula can be obtained by expanding the determinant along anyrow or column of the matrix. The expand-along-any-row-or-column nature of determinants can be very handy: if you need to calculate the determinant of a matrix with one row (or column) containing many zero entries, it makes sense to expand along that row since many of the terms in the formula will be zero. If a matrix contains a row (or column) consisting entirely of zeros, we can immediately tell its determinant is zero.  Geometric interpretation : Area of a parallelogram Suppose we're given vectors $overrightarrow{v} = (v_1, v_2)$ and $\overrightarrow{w} = (w_1, w_2)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and we construct a parallelogram with corner points $(0,0), \overrightarrow{v}, \overrightarrow{w}$ and $\overrightarrow{v} + \overrightarrow{w}$. The area of this parallelogram is equal to the determinant of the matrix that contains $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(w_1, w_2)$ as rows:$$area = \begin{vmatrix} v_1 &amp; v_2 \\ w_1 &amp; w_2 \end{vmatrix} = v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1 $$ Theoretical Linear Algebra : The things we are going to learn now are less concerned with calculations and more about mind expansion. This section extends what we know about the vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$ to the realm of abstract vector spaces of vector-like mathematical objects.  Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors : The set of eignevectors of a matrix is a special set of input vectors for which the action of the matrix is described as simple scaling . Decomposing a matrix in terms of its eigenvalues and its eigenvectors gives valuable insights into the properties of the matrix. Certain matrix calculations, like computing the power of the matrix, become much easier when use the eigendecomposition of the matrix For example, suppose we're given a square matrix $A$ and want to compute $A^7$. To make this example more concrete, we'll analyze the matrix $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 9 &amp; -2 \\ -2 &amp; 6 \end{bmatrix}$$We want to compute $A^7$. That would be an awful lot of matrix multiplications. Every matrix corresponds to some linear operation. This means it's legit to ask,  what does the matrix A do?  Once we figure out this part, we can compute $A^{77}$ by simply doing what $A$ does $77$ times. The best way to see what a matrix does is to look inside it and see what it's made of. To understand the matrix $A$, you must find it its eigenvectors and its eigenvalues. The eigenvectors of a matrix are a natural basis for describing the action ofthe matrix. The eigendecomposition is a change-of-basis operation that expresses the matrix $A$ with respect to its eigenbasis (own-basis). The eigendecompositions of the matrix $A$ is a product of three matrices:"

    "body": " Flatten Operation for a Batch of Image Inputs to a CNN : Flattening specific tensor axis is often required with CNNs because we work with batches of inputs opposed to single inputs. A tensor flatten operation is a common operation inside convolutional neural networks. This is because convolutional layer outputs that are passed to fully connected layers must be flattened out so that the fully connected layer can accept them as the input. A flatten operation is a specific type of reshaping operation where by all of the axes are smooshed or squashed together. To flatten a tensor, we need to have at least two axes. This makes it so that we are starting with something that is not already flat. For example, in the MNIST dataset, we will look at an handwritten image of eight. This image has 2 distinct dimensions, height and width. The height and width are $18 \times 18$ respectively. These dimensions tell use that this is a cropped image becaue the MNIST dataset contains $28 \times 28$ images. Let’s see how these two axes of height and width are flattened out into a single axis of length 324 (c. f. 324 what we get when multiplying 18 with 18).  Flattening Specific Axes of a Tensor : Tensor inputs to a convolutional neural network typically have 4 axes, one for batch size, one for color channels, and one each for height and width. [[B,C,H,W]] Suppose we have the following three tensors: t1 = torch. tensor([  [1,1,1,1],  [1,1,1,1],  [1,1,1,1],  [1,1,1,1]])t2 = torch. tensor([  [2,2,2,2],  [2,2,2,2],  [2,2,2,2],  [2,2,2,2]])t3 = torch. tensor([  [3,3,3,3],  [3,3,3,3],  [3,3,3,3],  [3,3,3,3]])Each of these has a shape of $4 \times 4$, so we have three rank-2 tensors. For our purpose, we’ll consider these to be three $4 \times 4$ images that we will use to create a batch that can be passed to a CNN. Batches are represented using a single tensor, so we’ll need to combine these three tensors into a single larger tensor that has 3 axes instead of 2. t = torch. stack((t1, t2, t3))t. shape &gt; torch. Size([3,4,4])Here, we used the stack() method to concatenate our sequence of tensors along a new axis. Since we have three tensors along a new axis, we know that the length of this axis should be 3. At this point, we have a rank-3 tensor that contains a batch of three $4 \times 4$ images. All we need to do now to get this tensor into a form that a CNN expects is add an axis for the color channels. We basically have an implicit single color channel for each of these image tensors, so in practice, these would be grayscale images. torch. reshape(3,1,4,4)Notice how the additional axis of length 1 doesn’t change the number of elements in the tensor. This is because the product of the components values doesn’t change when we multiply by one. The first axis has 3 elements. Each element of the first axis represents an image. For each image, we have a single color channel on the channel axis. Each of these channels contain 4 arrays that contain 4 numbers or scalar components.  Flattening the Tensor Batch : Let’s see how to flatten images in this batch. Remember the whole batch is a single tensor that will be passed to the CNN, we don’t want to flatten the whole thing We only want to flatten the image tensors within the batch tensor. For example, if we do the following operations on t: t. flatten() &gt;&gt; tensor([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,  2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3])# this is the same operation as t. flatten()t. reshape(-1)What I want you to notice about this output is that we have flattened the entire batch, and this smashes all the batches together into a single axis. The flattened batch won’t work well inside our CNN because we need individual predictions for each image within our batch tensor, and now we have a flattened mess. The solution here, is to flatten each image while still maintaining the batch axis . This means we want to flatten only part of the tensor . We want to flatten the color channel axis with the height and width axes.  The Axes that Need to be Flattened: $[C,H,W]$ This can be done with PyTorch’s built in flatten() function. t. flatten(start_dim=1). shape&gt;&gt; torch. Size([3,16])t. flatten(start_dim=1)&gt;&gt; [  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]])Notice how we specified the start_dim parameter. This tells the flatten() method which axis it should start the flatten operation. Now we have a rank-2 tensor with three single color channel images that have been flattened out into 16 pixels.  Flattening an RGB Image : If we flatten an RGB image, what happens to the color? Each color channel will be flattened first, then the flattened channels will be lined up side by side on a single axis of the tensor. For example, we build an RGB image tensor like the following code: r = torch. ones(1,2,2)g = torch. ones(1,2,2)+1b = torch. ones(1,2,2)+2img = torch. cat((r,g,b),dim=0)img. shape&gt;&gt; torch. Size([3,2,2])By flattening the image tensor, this is how it is going to look like. img. flatten(start_dim=0)&gt;&gt; tensor([1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 2. , 2. , 2. , 2. , 3. , 3. , 3. , 3. ]) Broadcasting and Element-Wise Operations with PyTorch : Remember, all these rules apply to PyTorch Tensors! Python built-in types such as list will not behave this way. Element-Wise Operations : An element-wise operation is an operation between two tensors that operates on corresponding elements within the respective tensors. Two elements are said to be corresponding if the two elements occupy the same position within the tensor. The position is determined by the indexes used to locate each element. Therefore, we can deduce that tensors must have the same shape in order to perform an element-wise operation.  Broadcasting Tensors : Broadcasting describes how tensors with different shapes are treated during element-wise operations. For example, suppose we have the following two tensors: t1 = torch. tensor([[1,1],[1,1]],dtype=torch. float32)t1. shape&gt;&gt; torch. Size([2,2])t2 = torch. tensor([2,4], dtype=torch. float32)t2. shape&gt;&gt; torch. Size([2])What will be the result of this two tensors’ element-wise addition operation? Even though these two tensors have differing shapes, the element-wise operation is possible, and broadcasting is what makes the operation possible. The lower rank tensor t2 will be transformed via broadcasting to match the shape of the higher rank tensor t1, and the element-wise operation will be performed as usual. The concept of broadcasting is the key to understanding how this operation will be carried out. We can check the broadcast transformation using the broadcast_to() numpy function. np. broadcast_to(t2. numpy(), t1. shape)&gt;&gt; array([[2. , 4. ],    [2. , 4. ]], dtype=float32)t1 + t2&gt;&gt; tensor([[3. , 5. ],    [3. , 5. ]])When do we actually use broadcasting? We often need to use broadcasting when we are preprocessing and especially during normalization routines.  Element-Wise Operation Applies to Comparision and Functions : Comparison operations are also element-wise operations. For a given comparison operation between two tensors, a new tensor of the same shape is returned with each element containing torch. bool value of True or False. It is also fine to assume that the function is applied to each element of the tensor.  there are other ways to refer to element-wise operations, such as component-wise or point-wise Argmax and Reduction Operations for Tensors : Now, we will focus in on the frequently used argmax() function, and we’ll see how to access the data inside our tensors.  Tensor Reduction Operation : A reduction operation on a tensor is an operation that reduces the number of elements contained within the tensor. Reduction operations allow us to perform operations on element within a single tensor. Let’s look at an example. Suppose we have the following rank-2 tensor: t = torch. tensor([[0,1,0],[2,0,2],[0,3,0]],dtype=torch. float32)t. sum()&gt;&gt; tensor(8. )t. numel()&gt;&gt; 9t. sum(). numel()&gt;&gt; 1The sum of our tensor’s scalar components is calculated using the sum() tensor method. The result of this call is a scalar-valued tensor . Since the number of elements have been reduced by the operation, we can conclude that the sum() method is a reduction operation. Other common reduction functions include t. sum(), t. prod(), t. mean() or t. std(). All of these tensor methods reduce the tensor to a single element scalar valued tensor by operating on all the tensor’s elements. Reduction operations in general allow us to compute aggregate values across data structures. But do reduction operations always reduce to a tensor with a single element? The answer is no. In fact, we often reduce specific axes at a time. This process is important.  References : deeplizard "

    "title": "Dissecting the Camera Matrix (Part 2)",
    "body": " Overview of the Camera Calibration Parameters The Extrinsic Camera Matrix : The extrinsic matrix takes the form of a rigid transformation matrix: a $3 \times 3$ rotation matrix in the left-block, and $3 \times 1$ translation column-vector in the right. [\begin{bmatrix}\begin{array}{ccc|c} r_{11} &amp; r_{12} &amp; r_{13} &amp; t_1  r_{21} &amp; r_{22} &amp; r_{23} &amp; t_2  r_{31} &amp; r_{32} &amp; r_{33} &amp; t_3\end{array}\end{bmatrix}] It is common to see a version of this matrix with extra row of $(0,0,0,1)$ added to the bottom. This makes the matrix square, which allows us to further decompose this matrix into a rotation followed by translation: [\begin{bmatrix}\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; t_1 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; t_2 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; t_3 \hline0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{array}\end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix}\begin{array}{ccc|c}r_{11} &amp; r_{12} &amp; r_{13} &amp; 0 r_{21} &amp; r_{22} &amp; r_{23} &amp; 0 r_{31} &amp; r_{32} &amp; r_{33} &amp; 0 \hline0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{array}\end{bmatrix}] The matrix describes how to transform points in world coordinates to camera coordinates. The important thing to remember about the extrinsic matrix is that it describes how the world is transformed relative to the camera . This if often counter-intuitive, because we usually want to specify how the camera is transformed relative to the world .  Building the Extrinsic Matrix from Camera Pose : Like I said before, it is often more natural to specify the camera’s pose directly rather than specifying how world points should transform to camera coordinates . Luckily, building an extrinsic camera matrix this way is easy: just build a rigid transformation matrix that describes the camera’s pose and then take its inverse . [\begin{bmatrix}\begin{array}{c|c}R &amp; t 0 &amp; 1 \end{array}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\begin{array}{c|c}R_c &amp; C 0 &amp; 1 \end{array}\end{bmatrix}^{-1}] Let $C$ be a column vector describing the location of the camera-center in world coordinates, and let $R_c$ be the rotation matrix describing the camera’s orientation with respect to the world coordinate axes. Then extrinsic matrix is obtained by inverting the camera’s pose matrix.  Algebraically a rotation matrix in $n$-dimensions is a $n \times n$ special orthogonal matrix, i. e. an orthogonal matrix whose determinant is 1.  We can define matrix $R$ that rotates in the $xy$-Cartesian plane counterclock-wise through an angle $\theta$ about the origin of the Cartesian system as follows:$$R = \begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta &amp; -\sin\theta \\\sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta\end{bmatrix}$$ The set of all rotation matrices form a group, known as the special orthogonal group. The inverse of a rotation matrix is its transpose, which is also a rotation matrix. $$\displaylines{R^T = R^{-1} \\det(R) = 1}$$ the extrinsic matrix is obtained by inverting the camera's pose matrix We here use the fact that the inverse of a rotation matrix is its transpose, and inverting a translation matrix simply negates the translation vector. Relationship between the extrinsic matrix parameters and the camera’s pose is straightforward: [\displaylines{R = R^T_c t = -RC}] References :  ksimek blog prateekvjoshi blog "

    "title": "All About Training GAN",
    "body": " 1.  Generative Adversarial Networks : Ultimately, if everything goes well, the generator learns the true distribution of the training data and becomes really good at generating fake images. The discriminator should not be able to distinguish between real and fake images. Another way to look at the GAN setup is that the discriminator is trying to guide the generator by telling what real images look like. The two networks try to achieve what is called the Nash Equilibrium with respect to each other.  2.  Training GANs : GAN networks are a dynamic system where the optimization process is seeking not a minimum, but a equilibrium between two forces. There are no good objective metrics for evaluating whether a GAN is performing well during training, e. g. reviewing the loss is not sufficient. Instead the best approach is to visually inspect the generated examples and use subjective evaluation. Other quantitative measures, such as Inception Score (IS) or Frechet Inception Distance (FID) rely on pretrained models with a specific set of object classes. They lack an upper bound (which means hypothetically the highest possible score is infinity).  2. 1 Look at the Loss : In a discriminative model,the loss measures the accuracy of the prediction and we use it to monitor the progress of training. However, the loss in GAN measures how well we are doing compared with our opponent. Often, the generator cost increases but the image quality is actually improving. If you see the discriminator loss rapidly approaching, there is probably no chance of recovery and it is time to change something.  2. 1 Look at the Gradients : Monitor the gradients along with the losses in the networks. These can give you a good idea about the progress of training and can even help in debugging if things are not really working well. Ideally, the generator should receive large gradients early in the training because it needs to learn how to generate real-looking data. The discriminator on the other hand does not always get large gradients early on, because it can easily distinguish real and fake images. If the gradients at the layer of generator are too small, learning might be slow or not happening at all. The generator should get large gradients early on and the discriminator getting consistently high gradients at the top layer once the generator has been trained enough.  3. Detecting GAN Failure Modes : The reason why GANs are difficult to train is that both generator and the discriminator are trained simultaneously in a zero-sum game. This means that improvements to one model come at the expense of the other model. The goal of training two models involves finding a point of equilibrium between the two competing concerns. It also means that everytime the parameters of one model are updated the nature of the optimization problem that is being solved is updated as well. The technical challenge of training two competing neural networks at the same time is that they can fail to converge.  Convergence Failure The fact that GANs are composed by two networks, and each of them has its loss function leads to GANs unstability. In GAN architecture, the discriminator tries to minimize a cross-entropy while the generator tries to maximize it. When discriminator confidence is high and the discriminator starts to reject the samples that are produced by the generator, generator's gradient vanishes. This scenario happens when the generator score reaches near zero and the discriminator score reaches near one. The discriminator is overpowering the generator. If the score does not recover from these values for many iterations, it is better to stop training.  Mode Collapse  Mode collapse is when the GAN produces a small variety of images with many duplicates. This happens when the generator is unable to learn a rich feature representation because it learns to associate similar outputs to multiple different inputs. The most promising way to check for mode collapse is to inspect the generated images. If there is little diversity in the output and some of them are almost identical, there is likely mode collapse. If you observe this happening, you should try to increase the ability of the generator to create more diverse outputs or impair the discriminator by randomly giving false labels to real images. Another type of behavior you should look out for is when the generator oscillates between generating specific examples in the domain. They progress from generating one kind of sample to generating another kind of sample without eventually reaching equilibrium.  Diminisheed Gradient  This situation happens when the discriminator gets too successful that the generator gradient vanishes and learns nothing. Lessons I Learned : Use a batch size smaller than or equal to 64. In my experience, using bigger batch sizes often hurt the performance. I suspect it fuels the problem of discriminator getting too good at discriminating the real and fake images, since large batch size means providing a lot of examples to train on.  Add noise to both real and synthetic data.  It is well known that making the training of discriminator more difficult is beneficial for the overall stability. Adding noise increases the complexity of the discriminator training and stabilizes the data distribution of the two competing networks.  Use Label Smoothing If the label for real images is set to 1, change it to a lower value like 0. 9. This solution discourages the discriminator from being overconfident.  Different learning rates for the generator and discriminator a. k. a. Two Time-Scale Update Rule In my experience, choosing a higher learning rate for the discriminator(i. e. 0. 0004) and a lower one(i. e. 0. 0001) for the generator works well in practice. I guess the reason is that the generator has to make small steps to fool the discriminator so it does not choose fast but not precise solutions to win the adversarial game.  Use some kind of normalization method For me, applying Spectral Normalization, a particular kind of normalization applied on the convolutional kernels, greatly helped the stability of training. I learned that hyperparameter tuning takes a lot of time and patience especially for training GANs. "

    "body": " Coordinate Systems : Introducing Coordinate Systems : Coordinate systems play an essential role in the graphics pipeline. They are not complicated; However, learning a few things about them will make it easier to understand matrices. I mentioned that points and vectors (as used in computer vision/graphics) are represented with 3 real numbers. But what do these numbers mean? Each number represents a signed distance from the origin of a line to the position of the point on that line. Consider drawing a line and putting a mark in the middle. We will call this mark origin. This mark becomes our point of reference: the position from which we will measure the distance to any other points. If a point lies to the right side of the origin, we take the signed distance to be greater than zero. On the other hand, if it is on the left side of the origin, the values will be negative. Now that we have a line and an origin, we add some additional marks at a regular interval (unit length) on each side of the origin, effectively turning our line into a ruler. With the ruler established, we can simply use it to measure the coordinate of a point from the origin (coordinate is another way of saying the signed distance from the origin to the point). In mathematics, the ruler defines what we call axis . We have just learned to define the coordinate of a point along an axis.  Dimensions and Cartesian Coordinate Systems : By placing two axes called $x$-axis and $y$-axis, we have defined a two dimensional space called a plane . These two axes are said to define a coordinate system.  If these two rulers are perpendicular to each other, they define what we call a Cartesian coordinate system.  We now know how to make a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system and define the coordinates of a 2D point in that coordinate system. Note that the coordinates of points defined in a coordinate system are unique &lt;/span&gt;. The same point cannot be represented by two different sets of coordinates in one system. We are free to choose any coordinate system that we please. In fact, we can choose to define infinitely many coordinate systems in a plane. Let’s assume we drew two Cartesian coordinate system like the figure above. On this paper, we place one point.  The coordinates of that point will be different depending on which of the two coordinate system we consider.  If you know the coordinates of $P$ in coordinate system $A$, what do you need to do to find the coordinate of the same point in another coordinate system $B$? This represents an extremely important operation in computer vision, and we will soon learn why and how to find the map which translates the coordinates of a point from one coordinate system to another. Another common operation is to move the point in the coordinate system $A$ to another location in the same coordinate system. This is called a translation and is certainly one of the basic operations you can do on points. Note that all sorts of other linear operators can be applied to point coordinates. A multiplication of a real number to the coordinate of point produces scale . A scale moves $P$ along the line that is going through the point and the origin. That is because when we are transforming a point we are actually transforming the vector going from origin to the point.  The Third Dimension : The 3D coordinate system is a simple extension of the 2D case. We will be adding a third axis orthogonal to both the $x$- and $y$-axis called the $z$-axis (representative of depth). In geometry, 3D coordinate system defines what is more formally known as Euclidean Space . In linear algebra, the three axes from what we call the basis of that coordinate system. A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that, in a linear combination, can represent every vector (or point) in a given vector space (the coordinate system).  Vectors from a set are said to be linearly independent if and only if none of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of other vectors in that set. Change of basis, or change of coordinate system, is a common operation in mathematics and computer vision pipeline.  Left-Handed vs Right-Handed Coordinate Systems : Unfortunately, due to various conventions concerning handedness, coordinate systems are not that simple. The problem can be illustrated in the following figure: when the up and forward vectors are oriented in the same way, an appropriate right vector can either point to the left or to the right. To differentiate the two conventions, we call the first coordinate system the left-handed coordinate system, and the other, the right-handed coordinate system.  Remember that the middle finger always represent the right vector when checking the coordinate handedness.  The handedness of the coordinate system also plays a role in the orientation of normals computed from the edges of polygonal faces. If the orientation is right-handed, then polygons whose vertices were specified in counterclockwise order will be front-facing. This will be explained in the part on rendering polygon objects.  The Right, Up and Forward Vectors : The Cartesian coordinate system is only defined by three perpendicular vectors of unit length. As far as the mathematical notation is concerned, this coordinate system does not convey anything about what these three axes actually mean. The developer is the one that decides how these axes should be interpreted. It is thus very important to make a clear distinction between the handedness of the coordinate system and the conventions used to label the corresponding axes. The choice of coordinate system handedness also plays a critical role when it comes to rotation and the cross product of two vectors. It’s actually easy enough (but painful) to go from one coordinate system to another. All that is needed is to scale the point coordinates and the camera-to-world matrix by $(1,1,-1)$.  The World Coordinate System : In most 3D applications, each different type of coordinate system is defined with respect to a master coordinate system called the world coordinate system. It defines the origin and the main $x$,$y$,$z$-axes from which all other coordinate systems are defined.  Math Operations on Points and Vectors : I have explained the concept of (Cartesian) coordinate system. Now we can look at some of the most common operations which can be performed on points and vectors.  Vector Length : The vector itself indicates not only the direction of point $B$ from $A$ but also can be used to find out the distance between $A$ and $B$. This is given by the length of a vector which can easily be computed with the following formula: [\lVert V \rVert = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}] The vector's length is sometimes also called norm or magnitude.  Note that the axes of the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate systems are unit vectors.  Normalizing a Vector : A normalized vector is a vector whose length is 1. Such a vector is also called a unit vector (it is a vector which has unit length). Normalizing a vector is very simple. We first compute the length of the vector and divide each one of the vector coordinates with this length. [\hat{V} = \frac{V}{\lVert V \rVert}] In mathematics, you will also find the term norm to define a function that assigns a length or size (or distance) to a vector. The function we have just described is called the Euclidean norm.  Dot Product : The dot product or scalar product requires two vectors $A$ and $B$ and can be seen as the projection of one vector onto the other. The result of the dot product is a real number. A dot product between two vectors is denoted with the dot sign: $A \cdot B$ (it can also sometimes be written as $&lt;A,B&gt;$). The dot product consists of multiplying each element of the $A$ vector with its counterpart from vector $B$ and taking the sum of each product. In the case of 3D vectors (they have three coefficients of elements which are $x$, $y$ and $z$), it consists of the following operation: [A \cdot B = A. x * B. x + A. y * B. y + A. z * B. z] Note that this is quite similar to the way we compute the length of a vector. If we take the square root of the dot product between two vectors ($\sqrt{A \cdot B}$) that are equal ($A=B$), then what we get is the length of the vector. We can write: [{\lVert V \rVert}^2 = V \cdot V] The dot product between two vectors is an extremely important and common operation in any 3D application because the result of this operation relates to the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. In this example vector $A$ is projected in the direction of vector $B$.  If $B$ is a unit vector then the product $A \cdot B$ gives $\lVert A \rVert \cos (\theta)$, the magnitude of the projection of $A$ in the direction of $B$, with a minus sign if the direction is opposite. This is called the scalar projection of $A$ onto $B$.  When neither $A$ nor $B$ is a unit vector, we can write that $A \cdot B / \lVert B \rVert$, since $B$ as a unit vector is $B/\lVert B rVert$.  In mathematics, $ {\cos}^{-1}$ is the inverse of the cosine function. When the two vectors are normalized ($A \cdot B / \lVert A \rVert \lVert B \rVert$), taking the arc cosine of the dot product gives you the angle $\theta$ between two vectors: $\theta = {\cos}^{-1}(A \cdot B / \lVert A \rVert \lVert B \rVert)$ or $\theta = {\cos}^{-1}(\hat{A} \cdot \hat{B})$.  The dot product is a very important operation in 3D. It can be used for many things. As a test of orthogonality. When two vectors $A$,$B$ are perpendicular to each other, the result of the dot product between these two vectors is $0$. It is also used intensively to find out the angle between two vectors or compute the angle between a vector and the axis of a coordinate system.  Cross Product : The cross product is also an operation on two vectors. The difference between cross product and dot product is that the dot product returns a number, whereas the cross product returns a vector. The particularity of this operation is that the vector resulting from the cross product is perpendicular to the other two.  The cross product operation is written using the following syntax:$$C = A \times B$$To compute the cross product we will need to implement the following formula:$$C_x = A_Y * B_Z - A_Z * B_YC_Y = A_Z * B_X - A_X * B_ZC_Z = A_X * B_Y - A_Y * B_X$$The result of this cross product is another vector which is  orthogonal to the other two. The two vectors $A$ and $B$ define a plane and the resulting vector $C$ is perpendicular to that plane. $A$ and $B$ don't have to be perpendicular to each other, but when they are, the resulting $A$, $B$ and $C$ vectors form a Cartesian coordinate system (assuming the vectors have unit length). If you need a mnemonic way of remembering this formula, we like to use the technique that consists of asking ourselves the question  why z? . $y$ and $z$ being the coordinates of vector $A$ and $B$ used to compute the $x$ coordinates of the resulting vector $C$. It is important to note that the order of the vectors involved in the cross product has an effect on the resulting vector $C$. You can see that $A \times B$ doesn't give you the same result as $B \times A$.  References : scratchpixel "

What amazed me was that in this nonjudgemental mode of observation of the ball, many of the technical elements of his swings would change spontaneously. The body was allowed its natural response to the perception of the ball, which was to step into it and hit it. This felt better and naturally produced better results. As coach, my first responsibility was to maintain a nonjudgemental focus, provide appropriate opportunity for natural learning, and stay out of the way. Paradoxicall,y it is conscious acceptance of oneself and one’s actions as they are that frees up both the incentive and the capacity for spontaneous change.

    "body": "2021/09/16 -  Coordinate Systems : Introducing Coordinate Systems : Coordinate systems play an essential role in the graphics pipeline. They are not complicated; However, learning a few things about them will make it easier to understand matrices. I mentioned that points and vectors (as used in computer vision/graphics) are represented with 3 real numbers. But what do these numbers mean? Each number represents a signed distance from the origin of a line to the position of the point on that line. Consider drawing a line and putting a mark in the middle. We will call this mark origin. This mark becomes our point of reference: the position from which we will measure the distance to any other points. If a point lies to the right side of the origin, we take the signed distance to be greater than zero. On the other hand, if it is on the left side of the origin, the values will be negative. Now that we have a line and an origin, we add some additional marks at a regular interval (unit length) on each side of the origin, effectively turning our line into a ruler. With the ruler established, we can simply use it to measure the coordinate of a point from the origin (coordinate is another way of saying the signed distance from the origin to the point). In mathematics, the ruler defines what we call axis . We have just learned to define the coordinate of a point along an axis.  Dimensions and Cartesian Coordinate Systems : By placing two axes called $x$-axis and $y$-axis, we have defined a two dimensional space called a plane . These two axes are said to define a coordinate system.  If these two rulers are perpendicular to each other, they define what we call a Cartesian coordinate system.  We now know how to make a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system and define the coordinates of a 2D point in that coordinate system. Note that the coordinates of points defined in a coordinate system are unique &lt;/span&gt;. The same point cannot be represented by two different sets of coordinates in one system. We are free to choose any coordinate system that we please. In fact, we can choose to define infinitely many coordinate systems in a plane. Let’s assume we drew two Cartesian coordinate system like the figure above. On this paper, we place one point.  The coordinates of that point will be different depending on which of the two coordinate system we consider.  If you know the coordinates of $P$ in coordinate system $A$, what do you need to do to find the coordinate of the same point in another coordinate system $B$? This represents an extremely important operation in computer vision, and we will soon learn why and how to find the map which translates the coordinates of a point from one coordinate system to another. Another common operation is to move the point in the coordinate system $A$ to another location in the same coordinate system. This is called a translation and is certainly one of the basic operations you can do on points. Note that all sorts of other linear operators can be applied to point coordinates. A multiplication of a real number to the coordinate of point produces scale . A scale moves $P$ along the line that is going through the point and the origin. That is because when we are transforming a point we are actually transforming the vector going from origin to the point.  The Third Dimension : The 3D coordinate system is a simple extension of the 2D case. We will be adding a third axis orthogonal to both the $x$- and $y$-axis called the $z$-axis (representative of depth). In geometry, 3D coordinate system defines what is more formally known as Euclidean Space . In linear algebra, the three axes from what we call the basis of that coordinate system. A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that, in a linear combination, can represent every vector (or point) in a given vector space (the coordinate system).  Vectors from a set are said to be linearly independent if and only if none of the vectors in the set can be written as a linear combination of other vectors in that set. Change of basis, or change of coordinate system, is a common operation in mathematics and computer vision pipeline.  Left-Handed vs Right-Handed Coordinate Systems : Unfortunately, due to various conventions concerning handedness, coordinate systems are not that simple. The problem can be illustrated in the following figure: when the up and forward vectors are oriented in the same way, an appropriate right vector can either point to the left or to the right. To differentiate the two conventions, we call the first coordinate system the left-handed coordinate system, and the other, the right-handed coordinate system.  Remember that the middle finger always represent the right vector when checking the coordinate handedness.  The handedness of the coordinate system also plays a role in the orientation of normals computed from the edges of polygonal faces. If the orientation is right-handed, then polygons whose vertices were specified in counterclockwise order will be front-facing. This will be explained in the part on rendering polygon objects.  The Right, Up and Forward Vectors : The Cartesian coordinate system is only defined by three perpendicular vectors of unit length. As far as the mathematical notation is concerned, this coordinate system does not convey anything about what these three axes actually mean. The developer is the one that decides how these axes should be interpreted. It is thus very important to make a clear distinction between the handedness of the coordinate system and the conventions used to label the corresponding axes. The choice of coordinate system handedness also plays a critical role when it comes to rotation and the cross product of two vectors. It’s actually easy enough (but painful) to go from one coordinate system to another. All that is needed is to scale the point coordinates and the camera-to-world matrix by $(1,1,-1)$.  The World Coordinate System : In most 3D applications, each different type of coordinate system is defined with respect to a master coordinate system called the world coordinate system. It defines the origin and the main $x$,$y$,$z$-axes from which all other coordinate systems are defined.  Math Operations on Points and Vectors : I have explained the concept of (Cartesian) coordinate system. Now we can look at some of the most common operations which can be performed on points and vectors.  Vector Length : The vector itself indicates not only the direction of point $B$ from $A$ but also can be used to find out the distance between $A$ and $B$. This is given by the length of a vector which can easily be computed with the following formula: [\lVert V \rVert = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}] The vector's length is sometimes also called norm or magnitude.  Note that the axes of the three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate systems are unit vectors.  Normalizing a Vector : A normalized vector is a vector whose length is 1. Such a vector is also called a unit vector (it is a vector which has unit length). Normalizing a vector is very simple. We first compute the length of the vector and divide each one of the vector coordinates with this length. [\hat{V} = \frac{V}{\lVert V \rVert}] In mathematics, you will also find the term norm to define a function that assigns a length or size (or distance) to a vector. The function we have just described is called the Euclidean norm.  Dot Product : The dot product or scalar product requires two vectors $A$ and $B$ and can be seen as the projection of one vector onto the other. The result of the dot product is a real number. A dot product between two vectors is denoted with the dot sign: $A \cdot B$ (it can also sometimes be written as $&lt;A,B&gt;$). The dot product consists of multiplying each element of the $A$ vector with its counterpart from vector $B$ and taking the sum of each product. In the case of 3D vectors (they have three coefficients of elements which are $x$, $y$ and $z$), it consists of the following operation: [A \cdot B = A. x * B. x + A. y * B. y + A. z * B. z] Note that this is quite similar to the way we compute the length of a vector. If we take the square root of the dot product between two vectors ($\sqrt{A \cdot B}$) that are equal ($A=B$), then what we get is the length of the vector. We can write: [{\lVert V \rVert}^2 = V \cdot V] The dot product between two vectors is an extremely important and common operation in any 3D application because the result of this operation relates to the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. In this example vector $A$ is projected in the direction of vector $B$.  If $B$ is a unit vector then the product $A \cdot B$ gives $\lVert A \rVert \cos (\theta)$, the magnitude of the projection of $A$ in the direction of $B$, with a minus sign if the direction is opposite. This is called the scalar projection of $A$ onto $B$.  When neither $A$ nor $B$ is a unit vector, we can write that $A \cdot B / \lVert B \rVert$, since $B$ as a unit vector is $B/\lVert B rVert$.  In mathematics, $ {\cos}^{-1}$ is the inverse of the cosine function. When the two vectors are normalized ($A \cdot B / \lVert A \rVert \lVert B \rVert$), taking the arc cosine of the dot product gives you the angle $\theta$ between two vectors: $\theta = {\cos}^{-1}(A \cdot B / \lVert A \rVert \lVert B \rVert)$ or $\theta = {\cos}^{-1}(\hat{A} \cdot \hat{B})$.  The dot product is a very important operation in 3D. It can be used for many things. As a test of orthogonality. When two vectors $A$,$B$ are perpendicular to each other, the result of the dot product between these two vectors is $0$. It is also used intensively to find out the angle between two vectors or compute the angle between a vector and the axis of a coordinate system.  Cross Product : The cross product is also an operation on two vectors. The difference between cross product and dot product is that the dot product returns a number, whereas the cross product returns a vector. The particularity of this operation is that the vector resulting from the cross product is perpendicular to the other two.  The cross product operation is written using the following syntax:$$C = A \times B$$To compute the cross product we will need to implement the following formula:$$C_x = A_Y * B_Z - A_Z * B_YC_Y = A_Z * B_X - A_X * B_ZC_Z = A_X * B_Y - A_Y * B_X$$The result of this cross product is another vector which is  orthogonal to the other two. The two vectors $A$ and $B$ define a plane and the resulting vector $C$ is perpendicular to that plane. $A$ and $B$ don't have to be perpendicular to each other, but when they are, the resulting $A$, $B$ and $C$ vectors form a Cartesian coordinate system (assuming the vectors have unit length). If you need a mnemonic way of remembering this formula, we like to use the technique that consists of asking ourselves the question  why z? . $y$ and $z$ being the coordinates of vector $A$ and $B$ used to compute the $x$ coordinates of the resulting vector $C$. It is important to note that the order of the vectors involved in the cross product has an effect on the resulting vector $C$. You can see that $A \times B$ doesn't give you the same result as $B \times A$.  References : scratchpixel "

    "title": "All About Training GAN",
    "body": "2021/09/14 -  1.  Generative Adversarial Networks : Ultimately, if everything goes well, the generator learns the true distribution of the training data and becomes really good at generating fake images. The discriminator should not be able to distinguish between real and fake images. Another way to look at the GAN setup is that the discriminator is trying to guide the generator by telling what real images look like. The two networks try to achieve what is called the Nash Equilibrium with respect to each other.  2.  Training GANs : GAN networks are a dynamic system where the optimization process is seeking not a minimum, but a equilibrium between two forces. There are no good objective metrics for evaluating whether a GAN is performing well during training, e. g. reviewing the loss is not sufficient. Instead the best approach is to visually inspect the generated examples and use subjective evaluation. Other quantitative measures, such as Inception Score (IS) or Frechet Inception Distance (FID) rely on pretrained models with a specific set of object classes. They lack an upper bound (which means hypothetically the highest possible score is infinity).  2. 1 Look at the Loss : In a discriminative model,the loss measures the accuracy of the prediction and we use it to monitor the progress of training. However, the loss in GAN measures how well we are doing compared with our opponent. Often, the generator cost increases but the image quality is actually improving. If you see the discriminator loss rapidly approaching, there is probably no chance of recovery and it is time to change something.  2. 1 Look at the Gradients : Monitor the gradients along with the losses in the networks. These can give you a good idea about the progress of training and can even help in debugging if things are not really working well. Ideally, the generator should receive large gradients early in the training because it needs to learn how to generate real-looking data. The discriminator on the other hand does not always get large gradients early on, because it can easily distinguish real and fake images. If the gradients at the layer of generator are too small, learning might be slow or not happening at all. The generator should get large gradients early on and the discriminator getting consistently high gradients at the top layer once the generator has been trained enough.  3. Detecting GAN Failure Modes : The reason why GANs are difficult to train is that both generator and the discriminator are trained simultaneously in a zero-sum game. This means that improvements to one model come at the expense of the other model. The goal of training two models involves finding a point of equilibrium between the two competing concerns. It also means that everytime the parameters of one model are updated the nature of the optimization problem that is being solved is updated as well. The technical challenge of training two competing neural networks at the same time is that they can fail to converge.  Convergence Failure The fact that GANs are composed by two networks, and each of them has its loss function leads to GANs unstability. In GAN architecture, the discriminator tries to minimize a cross-entropy while the generator tries to maximize it. When discriminator confidence is high and the discriminator starts to reject the samples that are produced by the generator, generator's gradient vanishes. This scenario happens when the generator score reaches near zero and the discriminator score reaches near one. The discriminator is overpowering the generator. If the score does not recover from these values for many iterations, it is better to stop training.  Mode Collapse  Mode collapse is when the GAN produces a small variety of images with many duplicates. This happens when the generator is unable to learn a rich feature representation because it learns to associate similar outputs to multiple different inputs. The most promising way to check for mode collapse is to inspect the generated images. If there is little diversity in the output and some of them are almost identical, there is likely mode collapse. If you observe this happening, you should try to increase the ability of the generator to create more diverse outputs or impair the discriminator by randomly giving false labels to real images. Another type of behavior you should look out for is when the generator oscillates between generating specific examples in the domain. They progress from generating one kind of sample to generating another kind of sample without eventually reaching equilibrium.  Diminisheed Gradient  This situation happens when the discriminator gets too successful that the generator gradient vanishes and learns nothing. Lessons I Learned : Use a batch size smaller than or equal to 64. In my experience, using bigger batch sizes often hurt the performance. I suspect it fuels the problem of discriminator getting too good at discriminating the real and fake images, since large batch size means providing a lot of examples to train on.  Add noise to both real and synthetic data.  It is well known that making the training of discriminator more difficult is beneficial for the overall stability. Adding noise increases the complexity of the discriminator training and stabilizes the data distribution of the two competing networks.  Use Label Smoothing If the label for real images is set to 1, change it to a lower value like 0. 9. This solution discourages the discriminator from being overconfident.  Different learning rates for the generator and discriminator a. k. a. Two Time-Scale Update Rule In my experience, choosing a higher learning rate for the discriminator(i. e. 0. 0004) and a lower one(i. e. 0. 0001) for the generator works well in practice. I guess the reason is that the generator has to make small steps to fool the discriminator so it does not choose fast but not precise solutions to win the adversarial game.  Use some kind of normalization method For me, applying Spectral Normalization, a particular kind of normalization applied on the convolutional kernels, greatly helped the stability of training. I learned that hyperparameter tuning takes a lot of time and patience especially for training GANs. "

    "body": "2021/09/14 -  Overview of the Camera Calibration Parameters The Extrinsic Camera Matrix : The extrinsic matrix takes the form of a rigid transformation matrix: a $3 \times 3$ rotation matrix in the left-block, and $3 \times 1$ translation column-vector in the right. [\begin{bmatrix}\begin{array}{ccc|c} r_{11} &amp; r_{12} &amp; r_{13} &amp; t_1  r_{21} &amp; r_{22} &amp; r_{23} &amp; t_2  r_{31} &amp; r_{32} &amp; r_{33} &amp; t_3\end{array}\end{bmatrix}] It is common to see a version of this matrix with extra row of $(0,0,0,1)$ added to the bottom. This makes the matrix square, which allows us to further decompose this matrix into a rotation followed by translation: [\begin{bmatrix}\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; t_1 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; t_2 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; t_3 \hline0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{array}\end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix}\begin{array}{ccc|c}r_{11} &amp; r_{12} &amp; r_{13} &amp; 0 r_{21} &amp; r_{22} &amp; r_{23} &amp; 0 r_{31} &amp; r_{32} &amp; r_{33} &amp; 0 \hline0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1\end{array}\end{bmatrix}] The matrix describes how to transform points in world coordinates to camera coordinates. The important thing to remember about the extrinsic matrix is that it describes how the world is transformed relative to the camera . This if often counter-intuitive, because we usually want to specify how the camera is transformed relative to the world .  Building the Extrinsic Matrix from Camera Pose : Like I said before, it is often more natural to specify the camera’s pose directly rather than specifying how world points should transform to camera coordinates . Luckily, building an extrinsic camera matrix this way is easy: just build a rigid transformation matrix that describes the camera’s pose and then take its inverse . [\begin{bmatrix}\begin{array}{c|c}R &amp; t 0 &amp; 1 \end{array}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}\begin{array}{c|c}R_c &amp; C 0 &amp; 1 \end{array}\end{bmatrix}^{-1}] Let $C$ be a column vector describing the location of the camera-center in world coordinates, and let $R_c$ be the rotation matrix describing the camera’s orientation with respect to the world coordinate axes. Then extrinsic matrix is obtained by inverting the camera’s pose matrix.  Algebraically a rotation matrix in $n$-dimensions is a $n \times n$ special orthogonal matrix, i. e. an orthogonal matrix whose determinant is 1.  We can define matrix $R$ that rotates in the $xy$-Cartesian plane counterclock-wise through an angle $\theta$ about the origin of the Cartesian system as follows:$$R = \begin{bmatrix}\cos\theta &amp; -\sin\theta \\\sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta\end{bmatrix}$$ The set of all rotation matrices form a group, known as the special orthogonal group. The inverse of a rotation matrix is its transpose, which is also a rotation matrix. $$\displaylines{R^T = R^{-1} \\det(R) = 1}$$ the extrinsic matrix is obtained by inverting the camera's pose matrix We here use the fact that the inverse of a rotation matrix is its transpose, and inverting a translation matrix simply negates the translation vector. Relationship between the extrinsic matrix parameters and the camera’s pose is straightforward: [\displaylines{R = R^T_c t = -RC}] References :  ksimek blog prateekvjoshi blog "

A tensor flatten operation is a common operation inside convolutional neural networks. This is because convolutional layer outputs that are passed to fully connected layers must be flattened out so that the fully connected layer can accept them as the input. A flatten operation is a specific type of reshaping operation where by all of the axes are smooshed or squashed together. To flatten a tensor, we need to have at least two axes. This makes it so that we are starting with something that is not already flat. For example, in the MNIST dataset, we will look at an handwritten image of eight. This image has 2 distinct dimensions, height and width. The height and width are $18 \times 18$ respectively. These dimensions tell use that this is a cropped image becaue the MNIST dataset contains $28 \times 28$ images. Let’s see how these two axes of height and width are flattened out into a single axis of length 324 (c. f. 324 what we get when multiplying 18 with 18).  Flattening Specific Axes of a Tensor : Tensor inputs to a convolutional neural network typically have 4 axes, one for batch size, one for color channels, and one each for height and width. [[B,C,H,W]] Suppose we have the following three tensors: t1 = torch. tensor([  [1,1,1,1],  [1,1,1,1],  [1,1,1,1],  [1,1,1,1]])t2 = torch. tensor([  [2,2,2,2],  [2,2,2,2],  [2,2,2,2],  [2,2,2,2]])t3 = torch. tensor([  [3,3,3,3],  [3,3,3,3],  [3,3,3,3],  [3,3,3,3]])Each of these has a shape of $4 \times 4$, so we have three rank-2 tensors. For our purpose, we’ll consider these to be three $4 \times 4$ images that we will use to create a batch that can be passed to a CNN. Batches are represented using a single tensor, so we’ll need to combine these three tensors into a single larger tensor that has 3 axes instead of 2. t = torch. stack((t1, t2, t3))t. shape &gt; torch. Size([3,4,4])Here, we used the stack() method to concatenate our sequence of tensors along a new axis. Since we have three tensors along a new axis, we know that the length of this axis should be 3. At this point, we have a rank-3 tensor that contains a batch of three $4 \times 4$ images. All we need to do now to get this tensor into a form that a CNN expects is add an axis for the color channels. We basically have an implicit single color channel for each of these image tensors, so in practice, these would be grayscale images. torch. reshape(3,1,4,4)Notice how the additional axis of length 1 doesn’t change the number of elements in the tensor. This is because the product of the components values doesn’t change when we multiply by one. The first axis has 3 elements. Each element of the first axis represents an image. For each image, we have a single color channel on the channel axis. Each of these channels contain 4 arrays that contain 4 numbers or scalar components.  Flattening the Tensor Batch : Let’s see how to flatten images in this batch. Remember the whole batch is a single tensor that will be passed to the CNN, we don’t want to flatten the whole thing We only want to flatten the image tensors within the batch tensor. For example, if we do the following operations on t: t. flatten() &gt;&gt; tensor([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2,  2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3])# this is the same operation as t. flatten()t. reshape(-1)What I want you to notice about this output is that we have flattened the entire batch, and this smashes all the batches together into a single axis. The flattened batch won’t work well inside our CNN because we need individual predictions for each image within our batch tensor, and now we have a flattened mess. The solution here, is to flatten each image while still maintaining the batch axis . This means we want to flatten only part of the tensor . We want to flatten the color channel axis with the height and width axes.  The Axes that Need to be Flattened: $[C,H,W]$ This can be done with PyTorch’s built in flatten() function. t. flatten(start_dim=1). shape&gt;&gt; torch. Size([3,16])t. flatten(start_dim=1)&gt;&gt; [  [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],  [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2],  [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]])Notice how we specified the start_dim parameter. This tells the flatten() method which axis it should start the flatten operation. Now we have a rank-2 tensor with three single color channel images that have been flattened out into 16 pixels.  Flattening an RGB Image : If we flatten an RGB image, what happens to the color? Each color channel will be flattened first, then the flattened channels will be lined up side by side on a single axis of the tensor. For example, we build an RGB image tensor like the following code: r = torch. ones(1,2,2)g = torch. ones(1,2,2)+1b = torch. ones(1,2,2)+2img = torch. cat((r,g,b),dim=0)img. shape&gt;&gt; torch. Size([3,2,2])By flattening the image tensor, this is how it is going to look like. img. flatten(start_dim=0)&gt;&gt; tensor([1. , 1. , 1. , 1. , 2. , 2. , 2. , 2. , 3. , 3. , 3. , 3. ]) Broadcasting and Element-Wise Operations with PyTorch : Remember, all these rules apply to PyTorch Tensors! Python built-in types such as list will not behave this way. Element-Wise Operations : An element-wise operation is an operation between two tensors that operates on corresponding elements within the respective tensors. Two elements are said to be corresponding if the two elements occupy the same position within the tensor. The position is determined by the indexes used to locate each element. Therefore, we can deduce that tensors must have the same shape in order to perform an element-wise operation.  Broadcasting Tensors : Broadcasting describes how tensors with different shapes are treated during element-wise operations. For example, suppose we have the following two tensors: t1 = torch. tensor([[1,1],[1,1]],dtype=torch. float32)t1. shape&gt;&gt; torch. Size([2,2])t2 = torch. tensor([2,4], dtype=torch. float32)t2. shape&gt;&gt; torch. Size([2])What will be the result of this two tensors’ element-wise addition operation? Even though these two tensors have differing shapes, the element-wise operation is possible, and broadcasting is what makes the operation possible. The lower rank tensor t2 will be transformed via broadcasting to match the shape of the higher rank tensor t1, and the element-wise operation will be performed as usual. The concept of broadcasting is the key to understanding how this operation will be carried out. We can check the broadcast transformation using the broadcast_to() numpy function. np. broadcast_to(t2. numpy(), t1. shape)&gt;&gt; array([[2. , 4. ],    [2. , 4. ]], dtype=float32)t1 + t2&gt;&gt; tensor([[3. , 5. ],    [3. , 5. ]])When do we actually use broadcasting? We often need to use broadcasting when we are preprocessing and especially during normalization routines.  Element-Wise Operation Applies to Comparision and Functions : Comparison operations are also element-wise operations. For a given comparison operation between two tensors, a new tensor of the same shape is returned with each element containing torch. bool value of True or False. It is also fine to assume that the function is applied to each element of the tensor.  there are other ways to refer to element-wise operations, such as component-wise or point-wise Argmax and Reduction Operations for Tensors : Now, we will focus in on the frequently used argmax() function, and we’ll see how to access the data inside our tensors.  Tensor Reduction Operation : A reduction operation on a tensor is an operation that reduces the number of elements contained within the tensor. Reduction operations allow us to perform operations on element within a single tensor. Let’s look at an example. Suppose we have the following rank-2 tensor: t = torch. tensor([[0,1,0],[2,0,2],[0,3,0]],dtype=torch. float32)t. sum()&gt;&gt; tensor(8. )t. numel()&gt;&gt; 9t. sum(). numel()&gt;&gt; 1The sum of our tensor’s scalar components is calculated using the sum() tensor method. The result of this call is a scalar-valued tensor . Since the number of elements have been reduced by the operation, we can conclude that the sum() method is a reduction operation. Other common reduction functions include t. sum(), t. prod(), t. mean() or t. std(). All of these tensor methods reduce the tensor to a single element scalar valued tensor by operating on all the tensor’s elements. Reduction operations in general allow us to compute aggregate values across data structures. But do reduction operations always reduce to a tensor with a single element? The answer is no. In fact, we often reduce specific axes at a time. This process is important.  References : deeplizard "

    "body": "2021/09/09 -  Computational Linear Algebra : This chapter covers the computational aspects of performing matrix calculations. Understanding matrix computations is important because all later chapters depend on them. Suppose we’re given a huge matrix $ A \in R^{n \times n} $ with $ n=1000 $. Hidden behind the innocent-looking mathematical notation of the matrix inverse $A^{-1}$, the matrix product $AA$, and the matrix determinant $ | A |$, lie monster coputations involving all the $1000 \times 1000 = 1$ million entries of the matrix $A$. Millions of arithmetic operations must be performed, so I hope you have at least a thousand pencil ready! Okay, calm down. I won’t actually make you calculate millions of arithmetic operations. In fact, to learn linear algebra, it is sufficient to know how to carry out calculations with $3 \times 3$ and $4 \times 4$ matrices. Even for such moderately sized matrices, computing products, inverses, and determinants by hand are serious computational tasks. If you’re ever required to take a linear algebra final exam, you need to make sure you can do these calculations quickly. Even if no exam looms in your imminent future, it’s important to practice matrix operations by hand to get a feel for them. This chapter will introduce you to the following computational tasks involving matrices: Gauss-Jordan elimination Suppose we're trying to solve two equations in two unknowns $x$ and $y$:$$ \displaylines{ax+by = c \\\dx+ ey= f}$$If we add $\alpha$\times the first equation to the second equation, we obtain an equivalent system of equations:$$\displaylines{ax + by = c \\\(d + \alpha a)x + (e + \alpha b)y = f + \alpha c}$$This is called a row operation : we added $\alpha$-times the first row to the second row. Row operations change the coefficient of the system of equations, but leave the solution unchanged. Gauss-Jordan elimination is a systematic procedure for solving systems of linear equations using row operations.  Matrix product The product $AB$ between matrices $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times l}$ and $B \in \mathbb{R}^{l \times n}$ is the matrix $C \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ whose coefficients $c_{ij}$ are defined by the formula $c_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{l}a_{ik}b_{kj}$ for all $i \in \lbrack 1, \dots, m \rbrack $ and $j \in \lbrack 1, \dots, n \rbrack $. We'll soon unpack this formula and learn about its intuitive interpretation: that computing $C = AB$ is computing all the dot products between the rows of $A$ and the columns of $B$.  Determinant The determinant of a matrix $A$, denoted $|A|$ is an operation that gives us useful information about the linear independence of the rows of the matrix. The determinant is connected to many notions of linear algebra: linear independence, geometry of vectors, solving systems of equations, and matrix invertibility. We'll soon discuss these aspects.  Matrix inverse We'll build upon our knowledge of Gauss-Jordan elimination, matrix products, and determinants to derive three different procedures for computing the matrix inverse $A^{-1}$. Reduced Row Echelon Form : In this section, we’ll learn to solve systems of linear equations using the Gauss-Jordan elimination procedure. A system of equations can be represented as a matrix of coefficients. The Gauss-Jordan elimination procedure converts any matrix into its  reduced row echelon form (RREF) . We can easily find the solution (or solutions of the system of equations from the RREF. Listen up: the material covered in this section requires your full on, caffeinated attention, as the procedures you’ll learn are somewhat tedious. Gauss-Jordan elimination involves many repetitive mathematical manipulations of arrays of numbers. It’s important you hang in there and follow through the step-by-step manipulations, as well as verify each step I present on your own with pen and paper.  Solving Equations : Suppose you’re asked to solve the following system of equations: [\displaylines{1x_1 + 2x_2 = 5 \3x_1 + 9x_2 = 21}] The standard approach is to use one of the equation-solving tricks we learned to combine the equations and find the values of the two unknowns $x_1$ and $x_2$. Observe that the names of the two unknowns are irrelevant to the solution of the system of equations. Indeed, the solution $(x_1, x_2)$ to the above system of equations is the same as the solution $(s,t)$ to the system of equations [\displaylines{1s+ 2t = 5 \3s+ 9t = 21}] The important parts of a system of linear equations are the coefficients in front of the variables and the constants on the right-hand side of each equation.  Augmented Matrix : The system of linear equations can be written as an augmented matrix : [\begin{pmatrix} 1 &amp; 2 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 5 \        3 &amp; 9 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 21\end{pmatrix}] The first column corresponds to the coefficients of the first variable, the second column is for the second variable, and the last column corresponds to the constants of the right-hand side. It is customary to draw a vertical line where the equal signs in the equations would normally appear. This line helps distinguish the coefficients of the equations from the column of constants on the right-hand side. Once we have the augmented matrix, we can simplify it by using row operations (which we’ll discuss shortly) on its entries. After simplification by row operations, the augmented matrix will be transformed to [\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 5 \0 &amp; 1 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 2\end{pmatrix}] which corresponds to the system of equations [\displaylines{x_1 = 1 \x_2 = 2}] This is a trivial system of equations; there is nothing left to solve and we can see that the solutions are $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 2$. This example illustrates the general idea of the Gauss-Jordan elimination procedure for solving the system of equations by manipulating an augmented matrix.  Row Operations : We can manipulate the rows of an augmented matrix without changing its solutions. We’re allowed to perform the following three types of row operations: Add a multiple of one row to another row Swap the position of the two rows Multiply a row by a constant Let’s trace the sequence of row operations needed to solve the system of equations [\displaylines{x_1 + 2x_2 = 5 \3x_1 + 9x_2 = 21}] starting from its augmented matrix: [\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 5 \3 &amp; 2 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 21\end{pmatrix}]  As a first step, we eliminate the first variable in the second row by subtracting three times the first row from the second row. [\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 5 \0 &amp; 3 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 6\end{pmatrix}] We denote this row operation as $R_2 \leftarrow R_2 - 3R_1$.  To simplify the second row, we divide it by 3 to obtain[\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 5 \0 &amp; 1 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 2 \end{pmatrix}] This row operation is denoted $R_2 \leftarrow \frac{1}{3}R_2$.  The final step is to eliminate the second variable from the first row. We do this by subtracting two times the second row from the first row $R_1 \leftarrow R_1 - 2 R_2$:[\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 1 \0 &amp; 1 &amp;\bigm | &amp; 2\end{pmatrix}] We can now read off the solution: $x_1 =1$ and $x_2 = 2$. Note how we simplified the augmented matrix through a specific procedure: we followed the Gauss-Jordan elimination algorithm to bring the matrix into its reduced row echelon form. The reduced row echelon form (RREF) is the simplest form for an augmented matrix. Each row contains a leading one (a numeral 1) also known as a pivot . Each column’s pivot is used to eliminate the numbers that lie below and above it in the same column. The end result of this procedure is the reduced row echelon form: [\begin{pmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; \ast &amp; 0 &amp;\bigm | \ast \0 &amp; 1 &amp; \ast &amp; 0 &amp;\bigm | \ast \0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp;\bigm | \ast\end{pmatrix}] Note the matrix contains only zero entries below and above the pivots. The asterisks $\ast$ denote arbitrary numbers that could not be eliminated because no leading one is present in these columns. The solution to a system of linear equations in the variables $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ is the set of values $\{(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n)\}$ that satisfy all the equations. Gaussian elimination is the process of bringing a matrix into row echelon form.  A matrix is said to be in row echelon form (REF) if all entries below the leading ones are zero. This form can be obtained by adding or subtracting the row with the leading one from the rows below it.  Gaussian-Jordan elimination is the process of bringing a matrix into reduced row echelon form.  A matrix is said to be in reduced row echelon form (RREF) if all the entries below and above the pivots are zero. Starting from the REF, we obtain the RREF by subtracting the row containing the pivots from the rows above them. the rank of the matrix $A$ is the number of pivots in the RREF of $A$.  Number of Solutions : A system of linear equations in three variables could have: one solution If the RREF of a matrix has a pivot in each row, we can read off the values of the solution by inspection. $$\begin{bmatrix}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; c_1 \\\0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; c_2 \\\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; c_3\end{bmatrix}$$The unique solution is $x_1 = c_1$, $x_2 = c_2$, and $x_3 = c_3$.  Infinitely many solutions 1 If one of the equations is redundant, a row of zeros will appear when the matrix is brought to the RREF. This happens when one of the original equations is a linear combination of the other two. In such cases, we're really solving two equations in three variables, so can't pin down one of the unknown variables. We say the solution contains a free variable . For example, consider the following RREF:$$\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; a_1 &amp; c_1 \\\0 &amp; 1 &amp; a_2 &amp; c_2 \end{bmatrix}$$The column that doesn't contain a leading one corresponds to the free variable. To indicate that $x_3$ is a free variable, we give it a special label $x_3 \equiv t$. The variable $t$ could be any number $t \in \mathbb{R}$. In other words, when we say $t$ is free, it means $t$ can take on any value from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$. The information in the augmented matrix can now be used to express $x_1$ and $x_2$ in terms of the right-hand constants and the free variable $t$:$$\begin{Bmatrix} x_1 = c_1 - a_1 t \\ x_2 = c_2 - a_2 t \\ x_3 = t, \forall t \in \mathbb{R} \end{Bmatrix} = \begin{Bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ c_2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + t \begin{bmatrix} -a_1 \\ -a_2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \forall t \in \mathbb{R}\end{Bmatrix}$$. The solution corresponds to the equation of a line passing through the point $(c_1, c_2, 0)$ with direction vector $(-a_1, -a_2, 1)$. We'll discuss the geometry of lines in the next section. For now, it's important that you understand that a system of equations can have more than one solution; any point on the line $l \equiv \{(c_1, c_2, 0) + t(-a_1, -a_2, 1), \forall t \in \mathbb{R}\}$ is a solution to the above system of equations.  Infinitely many solutions 2 It's also possible to obtain a two-dimensional solution space. This happens when two of the three equations are redundant. In this case, there will be a single leading one, and thus two free variables. For example, in the RREF$$\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; a_1 &amp; c_1 \\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}$$the variables $x_1$ and $x_3$ are free. As in the previous infinitely-many-solutions case, we define new labels for the free variables $x_1 \equiv s$ and $x_3 \equiv t$, where $ s \in \mathbb{R}$ and $t \in \mathbb{R}$ are two arbitrary numbers. The solution to this system of equations is $$ \begin{Bmatrix} x_1 = s \\ x_2 = c_2 - a_2 t \\ x_3 = t , \\ \forall s,t \in \mathbb{R} \end{Bmatrix} = \begin{Bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ c_2 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + s \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} + t \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ -a_2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}, \forall s,t \in \mathbb{R} \end{Bmatrix} $$This solution set corresponds to the parametric equation of a plane that contains the point $(0,c_2, 0)$ and the vectors $(1,0,0)$ and $(0, -a_2, 1)$. The general equation for the solution plane is $0x+1y+a_2z = c_2$, as can be observed from the first row of the augmented matrix. In the next section, we'll learn more about the geometry of planes and how to convert between their general and parametric forms.  no solutions If there are no numbers $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ that simultaneously satisfy all three equations, the system of equations has no solution. An example of a system of equations with no solution is the pair $ s+t = 4$ and $s+t = 44$. There are no numbers $(s,t)$ that satisfy both these equations. A system of equations has no solution if its reduced row echelon form contains a row of zero coefficients with a nonzero constant in the right-hand side:$$\begin{Bmatrix}\begin{array}{ccc|c}1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; c_1 \\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; c_2 \\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; c_3 \end{array}\end{Bmatrix}$$If $c_3 \neq 0$ this system of equations is impossible to satisfy. There is no solution because there are no numbers $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ such that $0x_1 + 0x_2 + 0x_3 = c_3$. Dear reader, we've reached the first moment in this book where you'll need to update your math vocabulary. The solution to an individual equation is a finite set of points. The solution to a system of equations can be an entire space containing infinitely many points, such as a line or a plane. The solution set of a system of three linear equations in three unknowns could be either the empty set $\{0\}$ (no solution), a set with one element $\{(x_1, x_2, x_3)\}$, or a set with infinitely many elements like a line $\{p_o + t \overrightarrow{v}, t \in \mathbb{R}\}$ or a plane $\{p_o + s \overrightarrow{v} + t \overrightarrow{w}, s,t \in \mathbb{R}\}$. Another possible solution set is all of $\mathbb{R}^3$; every vector $ \overrightarrow{x} \in \mathbb{R}^3 $ is a solution to the equation $$\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$$Note the distinction between the three types of infinite solution sets. A line is one-dimensional, a plane is two-dimensional, and $\mathbb{R}^3$ is three-dimensional. Describing all points on a line requires one parameter, describing all points on a plane takes two parameters, and-of course-describing a point in $\mathbb{R}^3$ takes three parameters.  Geometric Interpretation : We can gain some intuition about solution sets by studying the geometry of the intersections of lines in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and planes in $\mathbb{R}^3$.  Lines in two dimensions : Equations of the form $ax+by = c$ corresponds to lines in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Solving systems of linear equations of the form$$\displaylines{a_1 x + b_1 y = c_1 \\\a_2 x + b_2 y = c_2}$$requires finding the point $(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ where these lines intersect. There are three possibilities for the solution set:- one solution if the two lines intersect at a point. - infinitely many solutions if the lines are superimposed. - no solution if the two lines are parallel and never intersect. Planes in three dimensions : Equations of the form $ax+by+cz = d$ correspond to planes in $\mathbb{R}^3$. When solving three such equations, $$ \displaylines{a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z = d_1 \\\a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z = d_2 \\\a_3 x + b_3 y + c_3 z = d_3}$$we want to find a set of points $(x,y,z)$ that satisfy all three equations simultaneously. There are four possibilities for the solution set:1.  one solution three non-parallel planes intersect at a point. 2.  infinitely many solutions 1 if only one of the plane equations is redundant, the solution corresponds to the intersection of two planes which is a line. 3.  infinitely many solutions 2 if two of the equations are redundant, then the solution space is a two-dimensional space. 4.  if two (or more) of the planes are parallel, they will never intersect.  Determinants : Overview : What is the volume of a rectangular box of length $1m$, width $2$ and height $3m$? It's easy to compute the volume of this box because its shape is right rectangular prism. The volume of this prism is $V = l \times w \times h = 6m^3$. What if the shape of the box was a parallelpiped instead? A parallelpiped is a box whose opposite faces are parallel but whose sides are slanted. How do we compute the volume of a parallelpiped? The determinant operation, specifically the $3 \times 3$ determinant, is the perfect tool for this purpose. The determinant of a matrix, denoted $det(A)$ or $|A|$, is a particular way to multiply the entries of the matrix to produce a single number. We use determinants for all kinds of tasks: to compute areas and volumes, to solve systems of linear equations, to check whether a matrix is invertible or not, etc. We can interpret the determinant of a matrix intuitively as a geometrical calculation. The determinant is the volume of the geometric shape whose edges are the rows of the matrix. For $2 \times 2$ matrices, the determinant corresponds to the area of a parallelogram. For $3 \times 3$ matices, the determinant corresponds to the volume of a parallelpiped. For dimensions $d &gt; 3$, we say the determinant measures a $d$-dimensional hyper-volume . Consider the linear transformation $T: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2$ defined through the matrix-vector product with a matrix $A_T: T(\overrightarrow{x}) \equiv A_T \overrightarrow{x}$. The determinant of the matrix $A_T$ is the scale factor associated with the linear transformation $T$. The scale factor of the linear transformation $T$ describes how the area of a unit square in the input space (a square with dimensions $1 \times 1$) is transformed by $T$ . After passing through $T$, the unit square is transformed to a parallelogram with with area $det(A_T)$. Linear transformations that shrink areas have $det(A_T) &lt; 1$, while linear transformations that enlarge areas have $det(A_T) &gt; 1$. A linear transformation that is area preserving has $det(A+T) = 1$. The determinant is also used to check linear independence for a given set of vectors. We construct a matrix using the vectors as the matrix rows , and compute its determinant. The determinant of a matrix tells us whether or not that matrix is invertible . If $det(A) \neq 0$, then $A$ is invertible; if $det(A) = 0$, $A$ is not invertible. The determinant shares a connection with the vector cross product , and is used in the definition of the eigenvalue equation . Formulas : The determinant of a $2 \times 2$ matrix is $$det(\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \end{bmatrix}) = \begin{vmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \end{vmatrix} = a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}a{21}$$The formulas for the determinants of larger matrices are defined recursively. For example, the determinant of $3 \times 3$ matirx is defined in terms of $2 \times 2$ determinants:$$ \begin{vmatrix} a_{11} &amp; a_{12} &amp; a_{13} \\ a_{21} &amp; a_{22} &amp; a_{23} \\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \end{vmatrix} = a_{11} = a_{11} \begin{vmatrix}a_{22} &amp; a_{23} \\ a_{32} &amp; a_{33} \end{vmatrix} -a_{12} \begin{vmatrix} a_{21} &amp; a_{23} \\ a_{31} &amp; a_{33} \end{vmatrix}+ a_{13} \begin{vmatrix} a_{21} &amp; a_{22} \\ a_{31} &amp; a_{32} \end{vmatrix}$$ There's a neat computational trick for computing $3 \times 3$ determinants by hand. The trick consists of extending the matrix $A$ into a $3 \times 5$ array that contains copies the columns of $A$: the $1^{st}$ column of $A$ is copied to the $4^{th}$ column of the extended array, and the $2^{nd}$ column of $A$ is copied to the $5^{th}$ column. The determinant is then computed by summing the products of the entries on the three positive diagonals and subtracting the products of the entries on the three negative diagonals. The general formula for the determinant of an $n \times n$ matrix is$$det(A) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} (-1)^{1+j} a_{1j} M_{1j}$$where $M_{ij}$ is called the minor associated with the entry $a_{ij}$. The minor $M_{ij}$ is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing the $i^{th}$ row and the $j^{th}$ column of the matrix $A$. Note the alternating factor $(-1)^{i+j}$ that changes value between $+1$ and $-1$ for different terms in the formula. The determinant of a $4 \times 4$ matrix $B$ is $$ det(B) = b_{11}M_{11} - b_{12}M_{12} + b_{13}M_{13} - b_{14}M_{14}$$The general formula for determinants $det(A) = \sum_{j=1}^{n} (-1)^{1+j} a_{1j} M_{1j}$ assumes we're expanding the determinant along the first row of the matrix. In fact, a determinant formula can be obtained by expanding the determinant along anyrow or column of the matrix. The expand-along-any-row-or-column nature of determinants can be very handy: if you need to calculate the determinant of a matrix with one row (or column) containing many zero entries, it makes sense to expand along that row since many of the terms in the formula will be zero. If a matrix contains a row (or column) consisting entirely of zeros, we can immediately tell its determinant is zero.  Geometric interpretation : Area of a parallelogram Suppose we're given vectors $overrightarrow{v} = (v_1, v_2)$ and $\overrightarrow{w} = (w_1, w_2)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and we construct a parallelogram with corner points $(0,0), \overrightarrow{v}, \overrightarrow{w}$ and $\overrightarrow{v} + \overrightarrow{w}$. The area of this parallelogram is equal to the determinant of the matrix that contains $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(w_1, w_2)$ as rows:$$area = \begin{vmatrix} v_1 &amp; v_2 \\ w_1 &amp; w_2 \end{vmatrix} = v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1 $$ Theoretical Linear Algebra : The things we are going to learn now are less concerned with calculations and more about mind expansion. This section extends what we know about the vector space $\mathbb{R}^n$ to the realm of abstract vector spaces of vector-like mathematical objects.  Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors : The set of eignevectors of a matrix is a special set of input vectors for which the action of the matrix is described as simple scaling . Decomposing a matrix in terms of its eigenvalues and its eigenvectors gives valuable insights into the properties of the matrix. Certain matrix calculations, like computing the power of the matrix, become much easier when use the eigendecomposition of the matrix For example, suppose we're given a square matrix $A$ and want to compute $A^7$. To make this example more concrete, we'll analyze the matrix $$A = \begin{bmatrix} 9 &amp; -2 \\ -2 &amp; 6 \end{bmatrix}$$We want to compute $A^7$. That would be an awful lot of matrix multiplications. Every matrix corresponds to some linear operation. This means it's legit to ask,  what does the matrix A do?  Once we figure out this part, we can compute $A^{77}$ by simply doing what $A$ does $77$ times. The best way to see what a matrix does is to look inside it and see what it's made of. To understand the matrix $A$, you must find it its eigenvectors and its eigenvalues. The eigenvectors of a matrix are a natural basis for describing the action ofthe matrix. The eigendecomposition is a change-of-basis operation that expresses the matrix $A$ with respect to its eigenbasis (own-basis). The eigendecompositions of the matrix $A$ is a product of three matrices:"

    "title": "Batch Normalization and Group Normalization",
    "body": "2021/09/08 -  Batch Normalization: the Principles : Batch Normalization is an algorithmic method which makes the training of Deep Neural Networks faster and more stable . Batch normalization is computed differently during the training and the testing phase. At training , the BN layer determines the mean and standard deviation of the activation values across the batch. It then normalizes the activation vector with $\mu$ and $\sigma$. That way, each neuron’s output follows a standard normal distribution across the batch . It finally applies a linear transformation with $\gamma$ and $\beta$ which are the two trainable parameters. Such step allows the model to choose the optimum distribution for each hidden layer. $\gamma$ allows to adjust the standard deviation while $\beta$ allows to adjust the bias, shifting the curve on the right or on the left side. At each iteration, the network computes the mean $\mu$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$ corresponding to the current batch. Then it trains $\gamma$ and $\beta$ through gradient descent using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to give more importance to the latest iterations.  We mostly use Exponential Moving Average algorithm to reduce the noise or to smooth the data. The weight of each element decreases progressively over time, meaning the EMA gives greater weight to recent data points . EMA reacts faster to changes compared to Simple Moving Average. At the evaluation phase , we may not have a full batch to feed into the model. To tackle this issue, we compute $\mu_{pop}$ and $\sigma_{pop}$ as the estimated mean and standard deviation of the studied population . Those values are computed using all the $\mu_{batch}$ and $\sigma_{batch}$ during training, and directly fed during the evaluation phase.  Why Normalization? : What we can conclude from the original Batch Normalization paper is that:  Adding BN layers leads to better convergence and higher accuracy  Adding BN layers allows us to use higher learning rate without compromising convergence. To quote Ian Goodfellow about the use of batch normalization: Before BN, we thought it was almost impossible to efficiently train deep models using sigmoid in the hidden layers. Batch Normalization makes those unstable networks trainable. In practice, it is widely admitted that: For CNNs, Batch Normalization is better  For Recurrent Networks, Layer Normalization is better While BN uses the current batch to normalize every single value, LN uses all the current layer to do so.  The normalization is performed using other features from a single example instead of using the same feature across all current batch examples. The best way to understand why BN works is to understand the optimization landscape smoothness . BN reparameterizes the underlying optimization problem , making the training faster and easier. In additional recent studies, researchers observed that this effect is not unique to BN, but applies to other normalization methods (i. e. L1 normalization or L2 normalization).  The Drawbacks of BN : For BN to work, the batch size is required to be sufficiently large , usually at least 32 . However, there are situations when we have to settle for a small batch size. For example, when each data sample is highly memory consuming or when we train a very large neural network which leaves little GPU memory for processing data. For computer vision applications other than image classification, the restriction on batch sizes are more demanding and it is difficult to have higher batch sizes.  Comparisions of Normalization Methods : Group Normalization is one of the latest normalization methods that avoids exploiting the batch dimension, thus is independent of batch size. But there are other normalization methods as well.  Layer Normalization : Layer Normalization computes $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i$ along the (C,H,W) axes. The computation for an input feature is entirely independent of other input features in a batch.  Instance Normalization : Instance Normalization computes $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i$ along the (H,W) axes. Since the computation of IN is the same as that of BN with batch_size=1, IN actually makes the situation worse in most cases. However, for style transfer tasks , IN is better at discarding contrast information of an image, thus having superior performance than BN.  Group Normalization : Also notice that IN can be viewed as applying Layer Normalization to each channel individually as if the num_channels = 1. Group Normalization is the middle ground between IN and LN. It organizes the channels into different groups and computes $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i$ along the (H,W) axes and along a group of channels. First, the batch with dimension (N,C,H,W) is reshaped to (N,G,C//G,H,W). The number of group $G$ is a pre-defined hyperparameter . Then we normalize along the (C//G,H,W) dimension and return the result after reshaping the batch back to (N,C,H,w). Group Normalization is better than Layer Normalization as GN allows different distribution to be learned for each group of channels. GN is also thought to be better than IN because GN can exploit the dependence across channels. If `C = G`, that is, if the number of groups are set to be equal to the number of channels, GN becomes IN . Likewise, if `G = 1` GN becomes LN .

    "body": "2021/09/05 -  🌟 3D Reconstruction from 2D Signals : We are going to look at depth estimation as a multi-view problem. Multi-view problems can span into different domains including stereo vision, Structure from Motion and optical flow. Although each carries great importance in the problem of Virtual Reality (VR) and robotics, we will focus on stereo vision in this multi-part series. Specifically, the progress of deep learning in stereo vision technology. How can we automatically compute 3D geometry from images ? What cues in the image provide 3D information? Before looking at binocular, let’s consider single view characteristics. Well, we humans do so naturally. Here are several cues we use to infer depth information: shading texture  focus motion  perspective occlusion  symmetry Nonetheless, structure and depth are inherently ambiguous from a single view. As seen from the optical center (i. e. , camera location), $P1$ and $P2$ are projected onto the image plane as equivalent.  The Stereo Problem : Stereo vision systems reference the knowledge of two images captured simultaneously from a pair of cameras (left and right) with camera parameters (extrinsic and intrinsic). Stereo is heavily motivated by biology. Classic stereo problem include disparity, depth, occlusion, Structure from Motion, motion parallax etc. Provided left and right images, the ambiguity problem of the aforementioned is satisfied via triangulation from the two image planes by matching correspondences of a point in the world coordinate to the ones that can be seen in both images. The basic principle of triangulation is shown above: the reconstruction via the intersection of two rays. Requirements? Calibration and correspondences. Furthermore,  the Epipolar Constraint reduces the correspondence problem to $1D$ search along conjugate epipolar lines shown in the above figure. Thus, Epipolar Constraint assumes that stereo pairs are rectified images, meaning the same epipolar line aligns across rows such that it is orthogonal to both and aligned with one another. Rectification is achieved by learning a transformation based on intrinsic and extrinsic parameters: a process that dates back several decades. From the rectified image pair, the depth $Z$ can be determined by its inversely proportionate relationhip with disparity $d$, where the disparity is defined as the pixel difference along the horizontal when comparing correspondences of left and right. This can be written as: [I(x,y) = D(x+d, y)] This relationship is easiest to grasp visually. Provided a point in the left image plane $P_L(x,y)$ along with the correspondence in the right image plane and the world coordinates $(X,Y,Z)$ projected as a point in a 3D scene, our goal is to reconstruct the missing $Z$ (depth) provided the stereo pair. We set the relative coordinates (red axis) along with having known baseline $b$ between the two camera centers. Then $/frac{x_L}{f}$ can be expressed as $\frac{X+b/2}{Z}$ and $\frac{x_R}{f} = \frac{X-b/2}{Z}$. Therefore, [\frac{y_L}{f} = \frac{y_R}{f} = \frac{Y}{Z}] and the world coordinate can be expressed as [X = \frac{b(x_L+x_R)}{2(x_L - x_R)} Y = \frac{b(y_L + y_R}{2(x_L-x_R} Z = \frac{bf}{(x_L - x_R)}] $d = x_L - x_R$ is the disparity between corresponding left and right image points References :  article from medium "

    "title": "Dissecting the Camera Matrix (Part 1)",
    "body": "2021/09/05 -  Camera Calibration and Decomposition : Primarily, camera calibration is about finding the quantities internal to the camera that affect the imaging process. Here are some of the factors that will be taken care of:  image center : we need to find the position of the image center in the image. Wait, isn't the image center located at $(width/2, height/2)$? Well, no. Unless we calibrate the camera, the image will almost always appear to be off-center.  focal length : this is a very important parameter. Remember how people using DSLR cameras tend to focus on things before capturing the image? this parameter is directly related to the focus of the camera and it is very critical.  scaling factors : the scaling factors for row pixels and column pixels might be different. If we don't take care of this thing, the image will look stretched (either horizontally or vertically).  skew factor : this refers to shearing. the image will look like a parallelogram otherwise.  lens distortion : this refers to the pseudo zoom effect that we see near the center of any image.  shearing refers to a transformation in which all points along a given line $L$ remain fixed while other points are shifted parallel to $L$ by a distance proportional to their perpendicular distance from $L$.  Pinhole Camera Model : Before we jump into anything, let's see where this all began. When we capture an image, we are basically mapping the 3D scene to a 2D scene. It means that every point in the 3D world gets mapped to the 2D plane of our image. This is called the pinhole camera model . It basically describes the relationship between the coordinates of the 3D point and its projection on the 2D image. This, of course, is the ideal case where there is absolutely no distortion of any kind. Every camera is modeled based on this, and every camera aspires to simulate this as close as possible. But in the real world, we have to deal with things like geometric distortions, blurring, finite sized apertures, etc. The figure shown here depicts a pinhole camera model. The camera is placed at the origin $O$. The point $P$ represents a point in the real world. We are trying to capture that onto a 2D plane. The image plane represents the 2D plane that you get after capturing the image. The image plane actually contains the image that you see after capturing a picture. So basically, we are trying to map every 3D point to a point on the image plane. In this case, the point $P$ gets mapped to $P_c$. The distance between the origin $O$ and this image plane is called the focal length of the camera. This is the parameter you modify when you adjst the focus of the camera.  Intrinsic and Extrinsic Parameters : In the above figure, we want to estimate $(u,v)$ from $(X,Y,Z)$. Let's say the focal length is denoted by $f$. If you look at the triangle formed using the origin-$P_c$-and the $Z$-axis with the origin-$P$ and $Z$-axis, you will notice that they are similar triangles. This means that $u$ depends on the $f$, $X$ and $Z$. Similarly, $v$ depends on $f$, $Y$ and $Z$. $$\displaylines{u = fX/Z \\\v = fY/Z}$$Next, if the origin of the 2D image coordinate system does not coincide with where the $Z$-axis intersects the image plane, we need to translate $P_c$ into the desired origin. Let this translation be defined by $(t_u, t_v)$. So now, $u$ and $v$ are given by:$$\displaylines{u = fX/Z + t_u \\\v = fY/Z + t_v}$$So up until now, we have something that can translate $(X,Y,Z)$ to $(u,v)$. Let's denote this matrix $M$. So we can write:$$ P_c = MP$$Since this is a camera image, we need to express it in inches. For this, we will need to know the resolution of the camera in pixels/inch. If the pixels are square the resolution will be identical in both $u$ and $v$ directions of the camera image coordinates. However, for a more general case, we assume rectangular pixels with resolution $m_u$ and $m_v$ pixels/inch in $u$ and $v$ directions respectively. Therefore, to measure $P_c$ in pixels, its $u$ and $v$ coordinates should be multiplied by $m_u$ and $m_v$ respectively. So now, this new transformation matrix depends on $f, X, Y, Z, t_u, t_v, m_u, m_v$. Let's denote this by:$$P_c = KP$$Here, $K$ is called the intrinsic parameter matrix for the camera. Now, if the camera does not have its center of projection at $(0,0,0)$ and is oriented in an arbitrary fashion (not necessarily $z$-perpendicular to the image plane), then we need roation and translation to make the camera coordinate system coincide with the configuration in that pinhole camera figure. Let the rotation applied to coincide the principal axis with $Z$-axis given by a $3 \times 3$ rotation matrix $R$. Then the matrix is formed by first applying the translation followed by the rotation is given by the $3 \times 4$ matrix. $$E = \\( R|RT \\)$$This is called the extrinsic parameter matrix for the camera . So, the complete camera transformation can now be represented as: $$ K \\( R|RT \\) = KR \\( I|T \\)$$Hence, $P_c$ the projection of $P$ is given by:$$P\_c = KR \\( I|T \\) P = CP$$$C$ is a $3 \times 4$ matrix usually called the complete camera calibration matrix. So basically, camera calibration matrix is used to transform a 3D point in the real world to a 2D point on the image plane considering all the things like focal length of the camera, distortion, resolution, shifting of origin, etc.  References :  ksimek blog prateekvjoshi blog "

    "title": "Depth Estimation: Basics and Intuition",
    "body": "2021/09/02 -  Depth Estimation in Computer Vision : Depth estimation is also known as the inverse problem , where we seek to recover unknowns given insufficient information. So how do machines actually perceive depth? The earliest algorithm with impressive results began with depth estimation using stereo vision back in the 90s. A lot of progress was made on dense stereo correspondence algorithm Researchers were able to utilize geometry to constrain and replicate the idea of stereopsis mathematically. As for monocular depth estimation, it recently started to gain popularity by using neural networks. We will talk about this shortly after discussing stereo vision.  Depth Estimation from Stereo Vision : The main idea of solving depth using a stereo camera involves the concept of triangulation and streo matching . The former depends on good calibration and rectification to constrain the problem so that it can be modelled on a 2D plane known as epipolar plane . Epipolar plane greatly reduces the stereo matching problem to a line search along the epipolar line. Once we are able to match pixel correspondences between 2 views, the next task is to obtain a representation that encodes the difference .  This representation is known as disparity . The formula to obtain depth from disparity can be worked out from similar triangles.  Why is Measuring Depth So Difficult? : Before we move on, let’s try to understand some fundamental problems of depth estimation. The main culprit lies in the projection of 3D views to 2D images where depth information is lost . Another problem is deeply seeded when there are motion and moving objects .  Depth Estimation is Ill-Posed : Estimating depth from a single RGB image is an ill-posed inverse problem. What this means is that many 3D scenes observed in the 3D world can indeed correspond to the same 2D image plane.  Scale Ambiguity for Monocular Depth Estimation : The uncertain scale factor require current methods to have an additional sensor like LiDAR to provide depth ground-truth or stereo camera as additional training input, which makes them difficult to implement. Note that this issue exists only for monocular-based techniques , as the scale can be recovered for a stereo rig with a known baseline.

    "title": "3D Rigid Body Motion (Part 1)",
    "body": "2021/08/31 - Introduction: In this article, I will introduce one of the fundamental problems of visual SLAM: How to describe a rigid body’s motion in 3-dimensional space ? Intuitively, we certainly know that this consists of one rotation plus one translation . The translation part does not really have any problems, but the rotation part is questionable. I will introduce the meaning of rotation matrices, quaternions, Euler angles and how they are computed and transformed. Rotation Matrix: Points, Vectors, and Coordinate Systems: The space of our daily life is 3-dimensional, so we are born to be used to 3D movements. The 3D space consists of three axes, so the position of one spatial point can be specified by three coordinates. However, we should now consider a rigid body , which has its position and orientation . The camera can also be viewed as a rigid body in three dimensions, so what we care about in Visual SLAM are the problem of the camera’s position and orientation. Combined, we can say, “the camera is at the $(0,0,0)$ point, facing the front”. Let’s describe this in a mathematical term. We start from the basic content: points and vectors. Points are the basic element in space, no length, no volume. Connecting the two points forms a vector. A vector can be thought of as an arrow pointing from one point to another. Here we need to warn you not to confuse the vector with its coordinates. A vector is one thing in space, such as $a$. Here, $a$ does not need to be associated with several real numbers. We can naturally talk about the plus or minus operation of two vectors, without relating to any real numbers. Only when we specify a coordinate system in this 3D space can we talk about the vector’s coordinates in this system, finding several real numbers corresponding to this vector. With the knowledge of linear algebra, the coordinates of a point in 3D space can be described as $\mathbb{R}^3$. How to do we describe this? Suppose that in this linear space, we fined a set of base $(e_1, e_2, e_3)$ , then, an arbitrary vector $a$ has a coordinate under this base: $$ a = \begin{bmatrix} e_1 &amp; e_2 &amp; e_3 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{bmatrix} = a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + a_3 e_3 $$. Here, $(a_1, a_2, a_3)^T$ is called $a$’s coordinates. The coordinates’ specific values are related to the vector itself and the selection of the bases. In $\mathbb{R}^3$, the coordinate system usually consists of $3$ orthogonal coordinate axes (it can also be non-orthogonal, but it is rare in practice). For example, given $x$ and $y$ axis, the $z$ axis can be determined using the right-hand (or left-hand) rule. According to different definitions, the coordinate system is divided into left-handed and right-handed. The third axis of the left-hand rule is opposite to the right-hand rule. Most 3D libraries use right-handed coordinates. Based on basic linear algebra knowledge, we can talk about the operations between vectors/vectors, vectors/numbers, such as scalar multiplication, vector addition, subtraction, inner product, outer product and so on. For $a,b \in \mathbb{R}^3$, the inner product of $a,b$ can be written as: \$\$ a \cdot b = a^Tb = \sum_{i=1}^3 a_i b_i = |a\||b| \cos(&lt;a,b&gt;)\$\$where $ &lt;a. b&gt; $ refers to the angle between the vector $a, b$. The inner product can also describe the projection relationship between vectors. $$ a \times b = \begin{Vmatrix} e_1 &amp; e_2 &amp; e_3 \\ a_1 &amp; a_2 &amp; a_3 \\ b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; b_3 \end{Vmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a_2b_3 - a_3 b_2 \\ a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \\ a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -a_3 &amp; a_2 \\ a_3 &amp; 0 &amp; -a_1 \\ -a_2 &amp; a_1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} b = a \wedge b$$. The result of the outer product is a vector whose direction is perpendicular to the two vectors, and the length is $|a||b|\sin(&lt;a,b&gt;)$, which is also the area of the quadrilateral of the two vectors. From the outer product operation, we introduce the $\wedge$ operator here, which means writing $a$ as a skew-symmetric matrix . You can take $\wedge$ as a skew-symmetric symbol. It turns the outer product $a \times b$ into the multiplication of the matrix and the vector $a \wedge b$ is a linear operation. This symbol will be used frequently in the following sections. It is a one-to-one mapping, meaning that for any vector, it corresponds to a unique anti-symmetric matrix, and vice versa: [a \wedge = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; -a_3 &amp; a_2 \ a_3 &amp; 0 &amp; -a_1 \ -a_2 &amp; a_1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}] At the same time, note that the vector operations such as addition, subtraction, inner and outer products can be calculated even when we do not have their coordinates. For example, although the inner product can be expressed by the sum of the two vectors’ product when we know the coordinates, the length and angle can also be calculated even if their coordinates are unknown. Therefore, the inner product result of the two vectors is independent of the selection of the coordinate system. Euclidean Transforms between Coordinate Systems: We often define a variety of coordinate systems in the real scene. In robotics, you define one coordinate system for each link and joint; in 3D mapping, we also define a coordinate system for each cuboid and cylinder. If we consider a moving robot, it is common practice to set a stationary inertial coordinate system (or world coordinate system), such as the $x_W, y_W, z_W$ defined in the picture above. Meanwhile, the camera or robot is a moving coordinate system, such as coordinate system defined by $x_C, y_C, z_C$. We might ask: a vector $p$ in the camera system may have coordinates $p_c$; and in the world coordinate system, its coordinates maybe $p_w$ .  Then what is the conversion between two coordinates? It is necessary to first obtain the coordinate values of the point in the camera system and then use the transform rule to do the coordinate transform. We need a mathematical way to describe this transformation. As we will see later, we can describe it with a transform matrix $T$. Intuitively, the motion between two coordinate systems consists of a rotation plus a translation , which is called rigid body motion . Obviously, the camera movement is rigid. During the rigid body motion, the length and angle of the vector will not change. Imagine that you throw your phone into the air and there may be differences in spatial position and orientation. But the length and the angle of each face will not change. At this point, we say that the phone’s motion is Euclidean. The Euclidean transform consists of rotation and translation . Let’s first consider the rotation. We have a unit-length orthogonal base $(e_1, e_2, e_3)$. After a rotation it becomes $(e_1’, e_2’, e_3’)$. Then, for the same vector $a$ (the vector does not move with the rotation of the coordinate system). its coordinates in these two coordinate systems are $[a_1, a_2, a_3]^T$ and $[a_1’, a_2’, a_3]^T$. Because the vector itself has not changed, according to the definition of coordinates, there are: [[e_1, e_2, e_3] \begin{bmatrix} a_1 \ a_2 \ a_3 \end{bmatrix} = [e_1’, e_2’, e_3’] \begin{bmatrix} a_1’ \ a_2’ \ a_3’ \end{bmatrix}] To describe the relationship between the two coordinates, we multiply the left and right side of the above equation by $\begin{bmatrix} e_1^T \\ e_2^T \\ e_3^T \end{bmatrix}$, then the matrix on the left becomes an identity matrix, so: $$\begin{bmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{bmatrix} \triangleq Ra’$$. We take the intermediate matrix out and define it as a matrix $R$. This matrix consists of the inner product between the two sets of bases, describing the same vector’s coordinate transformation relationship before and after the rotation. It can be said that the matrix $R$ describes the rotation itself . So we call it the rotation matrix. Meanwhile, the components of the matrix are the inner product of the two coordinate system bases. Since the base vector’s length is $1$, it is actually the cosine of the angle between the base vectors. So this matrix is also called direction cosine matrix. The rotation matrix has some special properties.  In fact, it is an orthogonal matrix with a determinant of $1$. Conversely, an orthogonal matrix with a determinant of 1 is also a rotation matrix. So you can define a set of $n$ dimensional rotation matrices as follows:       $$SO(n) = \{ R \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}   RR^T = I, det(R) =1 \} $$   $SO(n)$ refers to the special orthogonal group. This set consists of a rotation matrix of $n$ dimensional space, in particular, $SO(3)$ refers to the rotation of the three-dimensional space. In this way, we can talk directly about the rotation transformation between the two coordinate systems without having to start from the bases. Since the rotation matrix is orthogonal, its inverse (i. e. , transpose) describes an opposite rotation. According to the above definition, there are: [a’ = R^{-1}a = R^Ta] Obviously, the $R^T$ represents an opposite rotation. In the Euclidean transformation, there is a translation in addition to rotation. Consider the vector $a$ in the world coordinate system. After a rotation (depicted by $R$) and a translation of $t$, we get $a’$. Then we can put the rotation and translation together, and have:$$a’= Ra+t$$,where $t$ is called a translation vector. Compared to the rotation, the translation part simply adds the translation vector to the coordinates after the rotation , which si very simple. By the above formula, we completely describe the coordinate transformation relationship using a rotation matrix $R$ and a translation vector $t$. In practice, we may define the coordinate system 1 and 2, then the vector $a$ under the two coordinates is $a_1, a_2$. The relationship between the two systems should be: $$a_1 = R_{12} a_2 + t_{12}$$. Here, $R_{12}$ means the “rotation of the vector from system 2 to system 1”. About $t_{12}$, readers may just take it as a translation vector without wondering about its physical meaning. In fact, it corresponds to a vector from the system 1’s origin pointing to system 2’s origin, and the coordinates are taken under tsystem 1. So I suggest you to understand it as “a vector from 1 to 2”. But the reverse $t_{21}$, which is a vector from $2$’s origin to $1$’s origin, whose coordinates are taken in system $2$, is not equal to $-t_{12}$. It is also related to the rotation of the two systems. Therefore, when beginners ask the question “What are my coordinates?”, we need to clearly explain this sentence’s meaning. Here, “my coordinates” normally refers to the vector from the world system $W$ pointing to the origin of the camera system $C$, and then take the coordinates in the world’s base. Corresponding to the mathematical symbol, it should be the value of $t_{WC}$. For the same reason, it is not $-t_{CW}$ but actually $-R^T_{CW} t_{CW}$. Transform Matrix and Homogeneous Coordinates: The formula $a’ = Ra+t$ fully expresses the rotation and the translation of Euclidean space, but there is still a small problem: the transformation relationship here is not a linear relationship. Suppose we made two transformations: $R_1,t_1$ and $R_2,t_2$:$$b = R_1 a + t_1, c = R_2 b + t_2$$. So the transformation from $a$ to $c$ is: $$c = R_2 (R_1 a + t_1) + t_2$$. This form is not elegant after multiple transformations. Therefore, we introduce homogeneous coordinates and transformation matrices, rewriting the formula:$$ \begin{bmatrix} a’ \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} R &amp; t \\ 0^T &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \triangleq T \begin{bmatrix} a \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$$. This is a mathematical trick: we add $1$ at the end of the 3D vector and turn it into a 4D vector called homogeneous coordinates. For this four-dimensional vector, we can write the rotation and translation matrix, making the whole relationship a linear relationship. In this formula, the matrix $T$ is called transform matrix. We temporarily use $\tilde{a}$ to represent the homogeneous coordinates of $a$. Then, relying on homogeneous coordinates and transformation matrices, the superposition of the two transformations can have a good form: $$\tilde{b} = T_1 \tilde{a}, \tilde{c} = T_2 \tilde{b} \Rightarrow T_2 T_1 \tilde{a}$$. But the symbols that distinguish between homogeneous and non-homogeneous coordinates are annoying, because here we only need to add 1 at the end of the vector or remove 1 to turn it into a normal vector. So, without ambiguity, we will write it directly as $b = Ta$ and by default we just assume a homogeneous coordinate conversion is made if needed. The transformation matrix $T$ has a special structure: the upper left corner is the rotation matrix, the right side is the translation vector, the lower-left corner is $0$ vector, and the lower right corner is $1$. This set of transform matrix is also known as the special Euclidean group: $$SE(3) = \{ T = \begin{bmatrix} R &amp; t \\ 0^T &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{4 \times 4}| R \in SO(3), t \in \mathbb{R}^3 \}$$. Like $SO(3)$, the inverse of the transformation matrix represents an inverse transformation: $$T^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix} R^T &amp; -R^T t \\ 0^T &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}$$. Again, we use the notation of $T_{12}$ to represent a transformation from 2 to 1. Because the conversion between homogeneous and non-homogeneous coordinates is actually very easy, it is assumed that the conversion from homogeneous coordinates to normal coordinates is already done. Summary: First, we introduced the vector and its coordinate representation and introduced the operation between the vectors; then, the motion between the coordinate systems is described by the Euclidean transformation, which consists of translation and rotation. The rotation can be described by the rotation matrix $SO(3)$, while the translation is directly described by an $\mathbb{R}^3$ vector. Finally, if the translation and rotation are placed in a matrix, the transformation matrix $SE(3)$ is formed. References:  Introduction to Visual SLAM"

    "body": "2021/08/31 - Introduction to Projective Geometry: Most of the time when working with 3D, we are thinking in terms of Euclidean geometry-that is, coordinates in three-dimensional space ($X$, $Y$ and $Z$). However, there are certain situations where it is useful to think in terms of projective geometry instead. Projective geometry has an extra dimension, called $W$, in addition to the $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ dimensions. This four-dimensional space is called projective space and coordinates in projective space are called homogenous coordinates. For the purposes of 3D software, the terms projective and homogeous are basically interchangeable with 4D. Not Quaternions: Quaternions look a lot like homogeneous coordinates. Both are 4D vectors, commonly depicted as $(X,Y,Z,W)$. However, quaternions and homogeneous coordinates are different concepts, with different uses. An Analogy in 2D: First, let’s look at how projective geometry works in 2D, before we move on to 3D.  Imagine a projector that is projecting a 2D image onto a screen. It’s easy to identify the $X$ and $Y$ dimensions of the projected image.  Now, if you step back from the 2D image and look at the projector and the screen, you can see the $W$ dimension, too. The $W$ dimension is the distance from the projector to the screen .  So what does the $W$ dimension do, exactly? Imagine what would happen to the 2D image if you increased or decreased $W$-that is, if you increased or decreased the distance between the projector and the screen. If you move the projector closer to the screen, the whole 2D image becomes smaller. If you move the projector away from the screen, the 2D image becomes larger. As you can see, the value of $W$ affects the size (a. k. a scale) of the image . Applying it to 3D: There is no such thing as a 3D projector (yet), so its’ harder to imagine projective geometry in 3D, but the $W$ value works exactly the same as it does in 2D. When $W$ increases, the coordinates expands (scales up). When $W$ decreases, the coordinates shrinks (scales down). The $W$ is basically a scaling transformation for the 3D coordinates . When $W = 1$: The usual advice for 3D programming beginners is to always set $W=1$ whenever converting a 3D coordinate to 4D coordinate. The reason for that is that when you scale a coordinate by a 1 it doesn’t shrink or grow, it just stays the same size. So, when $W=1$, it has no effect on the $X$, $Y$, or $Z$ values . For this reason, when it comes to 3D computer graphics, coordinates are said to be correct only when $W=1$. If you tried to render with $W=0$ your program would crash when it attempted to divide by zero. With $W&lt;0$ everything would flip unside-down and back-to-front. Mathematically speaking, there is no such thing as an incorrect homogeneous coordinate.  Using coordinates with $W=1$ is just a useful convention for the 3D computer grahics . The Math: Now, let’s look at some actual numbers, to see how the math works.  Let’s say that the projector is $3$ meters away from the screen, and there is a dot on the 2D image at the coordinate $(15, 21)$. This gives us the projective coordinate vector $(X,Y,W) = (15,21,3)$.  Now imagine that the projector was pushed closer to the screen so that the distance was $1$ meter. The closer the project gets to the screen, the smaller the image becomes. The projector has moved three times closer, so the image becomes three times smaller. If we take the original coordinate vector and divide all the values by three, we get the new vector where $W=1$:  $$(\frac{15}{3}, \frac{21}{3}, \frac{3}{3}) = (5,7,1)$$. The dot is now at coordinate $(5,7)$. This is how an incorrect homogeneous coordinate is converted to a correct coordinate: divide all the values by $W$. The process is exactly the same for 2D and 3D coordinates. Dividing all the values in a vector is done by a scalar multiplication with the reciprocal of the divisor. Here is a 4D example:  $$\frac{1}{5}(10, 20, 30, 5) = (\frac{10}{5}, \frac{20}{5}, \frac{30}{5}, \frac{5}{5}) = (2,4,6,1)$$ Uses of Homogeneous Coordinates in Computer Graphics: As mentioned earlier, in regard to 3D computer graphics, homogeneous coordinates are useful in certain situations. We will look at some of those situations here. Translation Matrices for 3D Coordinates:  A four-column matrix can only be multiplied with a four-element vector, which is why we often use homogeneous 4D vectors instead of 3D vectors. Rotation and scaling transformation matrices only require three columns. But, in order to do translation, the matrices need to have at least four columns . This is why transformations are often $4 \times 4$ matices. However, a matrix with four columns cannot be multiplied by a 3D vector, due to the rules of matrix multiplication. A four-column matrix can only be mulitplied with a four-element vector, which is why we often use homogeneous 4D vectors instead of 3D vectors. The 4th dimension $W$ is usually unchanged, when using homogeneous coordinates in matrix transformation. $W$ is set to $1$ when converting 3D coordinates into 4D, and is usually still $1$ after the transformation matrices are applied, at which point it can be converted back into a 3D coordinate by ignoring $W$. This is true for all translation, rotation, and scaling transformations, which by far are the most common types of transformations. The notable exception is projection matrices, which do affect the $W$ dimension. Perspective Transformation: In 3D, perspective is the phenomenon where an object appears smaller the further away it is from the camera. A far-away mountain can appear to be smaller than a cat, if the cat is close enough to the camera. Perspective is implemented in 3D computer graphics by using a transformation matrix that changes the $W$ element of each vertex. After the camera matrix is applied to each vertex, but before the projection matrix is applied, the $Z$ element of each vertex represents the distance away from the camera. Therefore, the larger $Z$ is, the more the vertex should be scaled down. The $W$ dimension affects the scale, so the projection matrix just changes the $W$ based on the $Z$ value. Here is an example of a perspective projection matrix being applied to a homogeneous coordinate:  $$ \begin{bmatrix} 1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0 \\ 0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp; \\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0 \\ 0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 1\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} $$ Notice how the $W$ value is changed to $4$, which comes from the $Z$ value. After the perspective projection matrix is applied, each vertex undergoes perspective division. Perspective division is just a specific term for converting the homogeneous coordinate back to $W=1$, as explained earlier in the article. Continuing with the example above, the perspective division step would look like this:  $$\frac{1}{4}(2,3,4,4) = (0. 5,0. 75, 1,1)$$ After perspective division, the $W$ value is discarded, and we are left with a 3D coordinate that has been correctly scaled according to a 3D perspective projection. Positioning Directional Lights: One property of homogeneous coordinates is that they allow you to have points at infinity (infinite length vectors), which is not possible with 3D coordinates. Points at infinity occur when $W=0$. If you try to convert a $W=0$ homogeneous coordinate into a normal $W=1$ coordinate, it results in a bunch of divide-by-zero operations:  $$ \frac{1}{0}(2,3,4,0) = (\frac{2}{0}, \frac{3}{0}, \frac{4}{0}, \frac{0}{0})$$. This means that homogeneous coordinates with $W=0$ can not be converted back into 3D coordinates. What use does this have? Well, directional lights can be thought of as point lights that are infinitely far away. When a point light is infinitely far away, the rays of light become parallel, and all of the light travels in a single direction. This is basically the definition of a directional light. So, traditionally, in 3D graphics, directional lights are differentiated from point lights by the value of $W$ in the position vector of the light. If $W=1$, then it is a point light. If $W=0$, then it is a directional light. This is more of a traditional convention, rather than a useful way to write lighting code. Directional lights and point lights are usually implemented with separate code, because they behave differently. Summary: Homogeneous coordinates have an extra dimension called $W$, which scales the $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ dimensions. Matrices for translation and perspective projection can only be applied to homogeneous coordinates, which is why they are so common in 3D computer graphics. The $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ values are said to be correct when $W=1$. Any homogeneous coordinates can be converted to have $W=1$ by dividing all four dimensions by the $W$ value, except if $W=0$. When $W=0$, the coordinate represents a point at infinity (a vector with infinite length), and this is often used to denote the direction of directional lights.
