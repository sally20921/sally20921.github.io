This is inline verbatim text: \verb+\LaTeX and a literal $+. This is non-inline verbatim text:
\begin{verbatim}
  % \begin{verbatim}
  %   This is verbatim text.
  % \end{verbatim}
\end{verbatim}
It would also be nice to support the environment from the Verbatim package:
\begin{Verbatim}
  % \begin{Verbatim}
  %   This is an even more powerful verbatim environment.
  % \end{Verbatim}
\end{Verbatim}
We'll see how it goes.
